That button \/ menuitem should integrate with our new IM component.  From Florian:  \"If we know that the contact is available, we should do the same thing as what happens when the user clicks the presence icon in an email header. If we don't know\/the contact isn't available, we should just fallback to the old behavior (ie starting the default AIM client of the system if there's an AIM screenname in the address book card)\"  So, I've started hacking on this, and I've noticed that the IM command also works when we have multiple contacts selected.  3 cases, with my question being in the 3rd:  Case 1:  User has selected all contacts that are online via the IM component. In this case, conversations are opened up with each contact, and the chat tab is opened to focus on the conversation with the last contact in the selection.  Case 2:  User has selected no contacts that are online via the IM component. In this case, we revert to the old behaviour, and attempt to communicate with all of those users via an AIM client.  Case 3:  User has selected some contacts that are online via the IM component. In this case...do we try to communicate with the available contacts via IM, and *also* open up the AIM client?",

This appears to be fallout from bug 619201, which now makes NSS initialise the certificate override service (nsICertOverrideService).  guessConfig.js tries to fill a global variable with the service when we open up the account wizard. The issue here is that it then causes NSS to initialise, which then means NSS tries to getService the nsICertOverrideService, at which point XPCOM complains.  I think the easiest way around this for us is to not have the global variable, but just use the service when we actually require it.",

Attachment statuses show up in the attachment list when viewing a bug, and users can query for bugs with certain attachment statuses.  Other features of the tool include the ability to mark attachments invalid, causing their descriptions to appear with strike-through style when viewing a bug, and the ability to view all attachments on one page in a series of iframes.  I also created a second enhancement to Bugzilla to enable users to request changes to data in Bugzilla from other users (f.e. setting a status on an attachment).  Requests generate email to the requestee and go into a queue stored in a database table.  When the requestee makes the change specified in the request, the request is marked fulfilled in the database, and the requester is notified via email.  Users can also view the queue of pending requests to track them.  Both enhancements are implemented as a set of new files (module, script, templates) along with hooks into several existing Bugzilla scripts.  While both enhancements were developed to meet specific mozilla.org needs to track the patch review process, they both store their definitions (attachment statuses and request types) in database tables so they can be completely customized for other uses.  I set up a test Bugzilla installation and filed a bug with several patches to demonstrate the tools:  http:\/\/landfill.tequilarista.org\/myk\/bzpacman\/show_bug.cgi?id=3  Create an account for yourself if you want to experiment in a more significant way.  http:\/\/landfill.tequilarista.org\/myk\/bzpacman\/  I am writing technical documentation on the enhancements and will post it as it becomes available.",

The data held by the outer code might be a closure, some component that the outer code has instantiated, some parameter, or whatever...  Solution 1: -----------    Outer code (myCodeModule.jsm):     1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", { chromeUrl: ... });     2: tab.browser.contentWindow.myFunc(myData);   Inner code (myChromePage.html):     3: function myFunc(aMyData) {     4:   ...     5: }    This is not a solution because, as http:\/\/hsivonen.iki.fi\/about-blank\/ tells   us, the <browser> that makes the chrome tab will start loading about:blank,   and we have no guarantee about the sequence of events. We'd like to make sure   that line 2: executes after the chrome page has been fully loaded and is   operational, but AFAIK, we have no such guarantee.  Solution 2: -----------    Outer code (myCodeModule.jsm):     1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", { chromeUrl: ... });     2: tab.browser.myData = ...;   Inner code (myChromePage.html):     3: document.addEventListener(\"onload\", function _myCallback () {     4:   let myData = top.myData;     5: });    This is not a solution because, as http:\/\/hsivonen.iki.fi\/about-blank\/ tells   us, the <browser> that makes the chrome tab will start loading about:blank,   and we have no guarantee about the sequence of events. We'd like to be sure   that _myCallback will never be called between lines 1 and 2, but AFAIK, we   have no such guarantee.    Other non-solutions: --------------------    - Pass the data as a URL parameter: not feasible, because the data cannot be     easily stringified.   - Use a global array, store the data in the array, pass the index to the inner     chrome page, have the chrome page retrieve its data using the global array.     Ugly.        Proposed solution: ------------------    Outer code:     1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", {     2:   chromeUrl: ...,     3:   onLoad: function (aEvent, aBrowser) {     4:     aBrowser.contentWindow.doStuff(withMyData);     5:   },     6: });   Inner code:     1: function doStuff(aMyData) { ... }    This solution has the advantage of offering all the guarantees we need. Plus,   it is intuitive, and in the course of developing a few addons, I've wanted   this everytime I've been interacting with content tabs. This solution is   implemented by the patch attached.  I might be missing something, but I remember discussing this extensively with bwinton (CC'd) over IRC, and if I recall correctly, we both came to the conclusion that I had to submit such a patch or duplicate the chromeTab functionnality in my own code and add the required hook.",

Instead of putting more special-purpose calls in the attachment manipulation functions, we should just use the observer service and send out some appropriate notifications. Here's what I'm thinking:  * attachmentAdded: fired when a single attachment is added (passes in the new attachment) * attachmentRemoved: fired when a single attachment is removed (passes in the   ex-attachment) * attachmentBatchAdded: fired when a group of attachments are added (e.g. if you add 3   attachments from a file picker) * attachmentBatchRemoved: fired when a group of attachments are deleted (e.g. if you   delete 3 attachments at once) * attachmentRenamed: fired when an attachment is renamed  Thus, if you attach 3 files at once from the file picker, it calls attachmentAdded three times, and then attachmentBatchAdded once.  This would be less invasive, so we could put BigFiles and the attachment reminder in separate .js files, and for the attachment reminder, we could make it more efficient (currently it listens for every attachment added, when it could listen for attachmentBatchAdded).

I  feel the performance hit is due to the large amount of outer joins that are being  used. To show the difference you can simple comment out the SelectVisible line in  buglist.cgi and re-run your query. The PostgreSQL branch was basically unusable  without this removal with a large amount of bugs (50,000+). So in the PostgreSQL  branch and now the Groups branch, I have altered to CanSeeBug to both take a  single bug and a list of bugs returning the list of bugs that can be seen by the  current user. This only adds one or two extra SQL queries (one for PostgreSQL,  two for Groups) to each buglist.cgi hit. For details you can check out the code from  either the Bugzilla_PgSql_Branch or the Bugzilla_Groups_Branch. I would be  interested in seeing how this performs with 100,000+ bugs such as  bugzilla.mozilla.org. Also if anyone is better at reading EXPLAIN output it would be  helpful to compare the two.",

        "FullDescription":"QuickSearch should be able to find a bug by its aliasOn b.m.o, the bug lookup text box in the footer supports lookup by alias. QuickSearch doesn't do this. It should, in some form.  Here is some discussion from the webtools newsgroup:  ======================= [jesse:] Btw, we should remove the \"alias\" field before it becomes  impossible to change the bug id boxes to search boxes.   The alias field is a workaround for searches being slow,   and searches will soon become faster. ======================= [afranke:] There is an alternative solution: Enable quicksearch to find bugs by their aliases (or substrings of their aliases).  Currently this can only be implemented as a special prefix, e.g. alias:bmo-regressions ,which would defeat most of the usability win. But when the perl port to quicksearch is checked, then it could first check whether one  of the non-prefixed word-fragments entered in the quicksearch  box occurs as a substring in some alias for a bug, and display  the matches at the top of the result page, before the \"normal\"  query results. And if you enter only a single string and there  exists a bug with exactly that alias, then the \"normal\" query  does not need to be executed anymore because the bug is probably  the one the user is looking for. In this case, there can be a  link on the result page that executes the normal quicksearch query, without looking for aliases again. ===================== [gerv:] A simpler alternative to your alternative - restrict aliases to the set  [A-Za-z-_] (if they aren't already) and then do an alias lookup first if  the search is a single word. ===================== [afranke:] Yes, but you still need the perl port of quicksearch  for this, because from JS you can't find out whether the returned result from show_bug.cgi?id=foo is a  bug view or a not-found error message, and fall back to the normal quicksearch in the latter case. Or can you do this? How? Btw, the perl-port checkin thing is in bug 70907.  (I still think substring search in the aliases is better than just exact lookup because e.g. you will want to hit bmo-regressions if you type in bmo, or regressions, or even regression.)",

The problem isn't that bugzilla  doesn't allow HTML posts, but that it messes up both the manual link and the  automatic link (if the anchor text is like \"Bug #10000\") in this case so that  other users must type the bug number manually (the horror :)  Bug #31322 shows a few test cases and the results.  Actual results: Bugzilla includes the > in the href and the anchor as part of  the URL.

This is not  something that I can devote effort to immediately, but I should be  able to spend some time on it in a couple of months.   A reasonable way to go about this probably involves serializing a bug  into XML and then sending it across the network and deserializing it  (parallelizing it? :-).      A large part of the motivation for this relates to the ability for folks who have written their own packages based on Mozilla to be able to keep track  of their bugs in their own instance of Bugzilla, which still being  able to move bugs that are truly in the core code back to the  mozilla.org instance with ease.

        "FullDescription":"gnats2bz.pl rewriteFor converting the gcc gnats database from gnats to bugzilla, we needed a lot more features than gnats2bz.pl So I worked on it quite a bit, making it faster, and adding a ton of features. It's basically a rewrite, in that i've added more code than existed before.  I was asked to file an RFE with the script attached, so i'm doing so. List of changes:  10x faster (used to take 45 minutes to handle the 270 meg of gcc gnats reports, now takes 4.5 minutes), even with all the rest of the changes.  Mainly due to changing the pr parser to be based on the one in gnatsweb, which is absurdly fast. If you don't need any of the below, just replacing the parser will probably buy you a 20x speedup (i didn't do speed testing till i was finished, but its a bit slower than it was when i first replaced the parser)  Chunks audit trail into separate comments, with the right From's, times, etc.  Handles followup emails that are in the report, with the right From's, times, etc.  Properly handles duplicates, adding the standard bugzilla duplicate message.  Extracts and handles gnatsweb attachments, as well as uuencoded attachments appearing in either followup emails, the how-to-repeat field, etc.  Replaces them with a message to look at the attachments list, and adds the standard \"Created an attachment\" message that bugzilla uses.  Handling them includes giving them the right name and mime-type. \"attachments\" means multiple uuencoded things\/gnatsweb attachments are handled properly.  Handles reopened bug reports.  Builds the cc list from the people who have commented on the report, and the reporter.  Other things i've forgotten, i'm sure (I fixed many bugs regarding parsing of email addresses, etc)  It's hard, at first glance, to tell the result from a bugzilla database built from scratch.  The patch is actually larger than gnats2bz.pl currently.  It has a *few* gcc specific things that are easy to remove:  1.  we don't use op_sys and rep_platform, since you can build on any host, for any build os, for any target.  Thus, we use a build, host, and target field with the triplet (ie i686-pc-linux-gnu) in them. 2.  Because almost all of our attachments are text, and large text at that (preprocessed source files), all attachments data is compressed with  Compress::Zlib.   This is also because noone will ever want to full-text search it.  Removing these two is a matter of just changing a few lines.  You can see the result (no changes, this is what running the script gives you) at www.dberlin.org\/bugzilla-2.14",

The reason is that these products that these allow an UNCONFIRMED status.  UNCONFIRMED will automatically turn into NEW once it has a certain number of votes (about 3 I think).  Therefore, someone could assign of all their votes to a bug to confirm it and then remove them.  The intention was that 3 different people should have to assign their votes.  Removing multiple voting was a kludgy workaround to ensure this.  Better would be if it checked the number of voters was >= 3.

The situation this last weekend at bugzilla.mozilla.org is a real good example of a tragedy that could have been prevented had a common perl gotcha been noticed by either of the two people who reviewed a certain patch.  (See bug 95890 if you want all the gory details - short story is b.m.o is having to pull a backup and reconstruct a good portion of the bugs_activity table)  To start off the common gotchas section: 1) Any variable included inside a regular expression must be quoted with \\Q..\\E unless the variable is intended to contain a regular expression. 2) avoid using regexps for grep if you're looking for an exact match, instead use a code block to compare equivalency ( grep($_ eq $matchstr, @list); )  These two are what bit us in the butt on b.m.o the other day.I'm sure we can come up with more, too.  In this guide, we should also come up with some standard testing procedures for testing new code before it's checked into cvs.  We have landfill at our disposal, but it doesn't seem to be enough.  Is there stuff we can add to landfill to assist testing?  Or certain tests we need to remember to perform?  Maybe we should make a requirement in the reviewer guide that a list of things that need to be tested to validate a given patch should be included in the bug report before the patch is tested and checked in...

Currently there are (I think) around 400 bugs targetted at 2.18, a figure which, from past experience, seems impossible to achieve.  So what can be done to make the milestones more realistic, so we don't keep bumping them up each release?  I'm primarily not really just looking for an \"I'll do it\", as there's no evidence you'd be any better.  There are just too many things that need doing NOW.  Is there any benefit in transferring this task over to the component owners?  Would they bother?  This is a brainstorming bug, no idea is too ridiculous - it could lead onto a useful idea.",

I'm not sure if they're supposed to be there, but the really seem out-of-place. After looking at them for a while, I suppose they *kinda* look like the dividers in the menu bar, but they still seem fairly out-of-place. Perhaps someone should remove them in the next update?  Also the Firefox button will change to this glyph, see: http:\/\/people.mozilla.com\/~shorlander\/files\/australis-designSpecs\/australis-designSpecs-windows7-mainWindow.html. Other OS and applications are also using this symbol for menus and this will help to faster recognize there is a menu behind this button.

        "FullDescription":"Use listbox with input for CC management on bug form,[patch] Use listbox with input for CC management on bug formWith some bugs now getting long lists of CCs on them, trying to edit the list of  CCs starts to be a chore.  You can accidently remove someone if you remove one  letter from their email address while trying to edit the list.  What I propose is  to place a listbox on the form with the current CC addresses in it.  Under the  listbox would be a checkbox for \"remove selected addresses\".  If you want to  remove someone, you select their name in the list, and check the remove box.   There would also be a text input under it for \"Add CC\" to allow you to add one or  more additional addresses.  For related bugs that aren't quite the same, see: - bug 7345 (blind CCs) - bug 28849 (don't allow non-editors to add\/remove anyone other than themselves)  - bug 34488 (button to add me to the CC list)  I am attaching two files to this bug.  The first is a diff of bug_form.pl with  the code changes to place this list on the form.  The second is an HTML file with  the output of the above form.  NOTE: DO NOT install this on a production Bugzilla (yet).  Although this  bug_form.pl is fully functional, I have not modified process_bug.cgi to handle  the revised fields yet, and it'll break things without both files being updated.   I'm putting this here now so people can look at it.  Feel free to put it on a  test installation and look at bugs with it, but don't try changing them or you'll  likely delete people off the CC lists. :)  Regarding process_bug.cgi, I would like help updating this to handle the new  fields.  I do not quite understand what it's doing, and don't want to break it.   I could probably figure it out if I stared at it a while, but if whoever wrote  the RelationSet.pm thing would take a look at it, it would probably be much  easier for them.

If an administrator-type person goes to editusers.cgi, and adds a new user from  there, the userregexps of the various groups are completely ignored.  Obviously,  the administrator has the ability to add the user to groups directly on the new  user screen.  Furthermore, there's no way to default the various checkboxes  before the login name is put in, so we can't start some of them checked unless  we turn it into a two-step process.  I see three feasible resolutions, off the top of my head:  1) This is a feature, not a bug.  We want to pretend that the userregexps don't  exist when entering users this way.  2) We can turn this into a two-step process, first entering the login name (and  Real Name, perhaps), and then doing the rest, and checking the checkboxes for  matching groups then.  3) At the least, we could have it emit some sort of warning if the login name  matches a regexp for a group into which the user was not put.  That way the  administrator can go and modify the permissions for the user, or ignore it, but  it will be intentional, and not an accidental miss.",

Based on the comments, it looks    like this should actually appear as disabled, not invisible.

The stated purpose of the sticky bit is that any given user can only delete files that they created.  However, it also appears to restrict you from moving\/renaming files in that directory as well, if you're not the owner of the directory.  The Param() function attempts to build a data\/params file if there are missing params in it by merging the defaults with the existing params file and writing it to a new file, then renaming the new file to the old filename.  I've duplicated this both on Mac OS X (darwin) and on Red Hat 6.2 (linux)  This especially hurts a new install because any CGI in Bugzilla will crash with a 500 Server Error because the data\/params file doesn't exist and it can't create one.

Bugzilla requires javascript to make its queries If Javascript is disabled, if someone uses the search shortcut on Bugzilla's main page, Bugzilla will use the entered keywords as IDs not as search terms. Thus it will display an error message saying that the error number is incorrect.  It should in fact detect that the search terms were not IDs and that javascript must be enabled.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start Mozilla without javascript (I guess it does the same with IE) 2. Go to the web page, enter some keywords in the textbox (e.g. 'Bugzilla search') and press enter 3. Bugzilla will display an error message saying that bug number is invalid. 4. enable javascript 5. back 6. press enter again. Same error (possible other bug? - see additional information) 7. back 8. press enter again. javascript is taken into account and search terms are detected.  Actual Results:  The error message display that the bug ID is invalid. The message is inexplicit.  Expected Results:  The error message contains a message saying that javascript must be turned on.

It is complementary to bug 61561 which is a request to integrate this tool into the bugzilla front page on bugzilla.mozilla.org .  Description of the tool: ======================== The QuickSearch tool is an alternative query tool for bugzilla. The UI is as simple as possible: a single text box. And it should be simple to use for newbies: you can just enter some words and press return, and it will give you a list of bugs. Currently, this is a JS-based client-side tool, but it could be ported to perl in the future.  Reasons for including it into CVS: ================================== The tool can be useful for all bugzilla installations. All mozilla-specific values are defined in a separate file (currently called \"localconfig.js\"), so it should be easy to use it in other installations. It works fine for me so far, and I already prefer it over query.cgi more than 80 percent of the time. I consider it production level quality. Checking it in will hopefully increase the chance that someone finds it useful and starts hacking on it.  Files involved: =============== quicksearch.html     (query form with first part of the documentation) quicksearchhack.html (extended query form with second part of the documentation) quicksearch.js       (main part of the JS sources) localconfig.js       (installation-specific values) optional: index.html (for integration into the front page)  I'm going to attach the files soon.",

        "FullDescription":"Small change for target milestones,describe Milestone URL in edit products pageSorry for the brevity, it made sense to me at the time :)  On the edit products page there is a field labeled \"Milestone URL:\".  It is a url to a file that describes what the milestones are for each product.  The url is used to create a link when viewing a bug, the words \"Target Milestone\", next to the pull down list, becomes a link that takes you to the page you specify in the \"Milestone URL:\".  I found that the words \"Milestone URL:\" were insufficient to describe the above effects.  I think that if the notargetmilestone.html file that is included with bugzilla where the default entry in this field whenever a componenet was created, it would be more intuitive and clearer. 1)  It would then create the link on every bug so that you wouldn't have the erratic behavior of \"Target Milestone\" sometimes being a link and other times not.  Currently if the \"Milestone URL:\" field is empty, no link is created. 2)  This could also be resolved by a short paragraph that describes what in blue blazes the \"Milestone URL:\" on the edit products page does. Hope this helps clear this up.  I think this would be an easy fix, depending on what method is implemented (both preferably).  I might even patch this myself when i get time :)",

Among the bugs one or more weeks old, most have had some comment added, so at present there is no good way to zero in on these bugs.  Now that boolean charts have been added, it would always be possible to AND a search with the bugs that do not contain the string \"-- Additional Comments From\", but that would be brutally expensive.  Since it probably isn't going to ever be necessary to know the number of comments added, this would amount to adding a boolean field, set to 0 when a  bug is created, and set to 1 when a comment is added.

        "FullDescription":"SECURITY: predictable sessionid (Bugzilla_logincookie),SECURITY: predictable sessionid (Use a token instead of logincookie)We're using bugzilla at work for some internal development projects; thank you for your continued work on this project.  Today I noticed a security problem with the session management\/authentication system. Bugzilla requires two cookies: one with the userid, the other with a session number. The session value is sequential, and therefore (relatively) easily guessed. An attacker could theoretically assume someone else's identity by noting their email address (which is in all the tickets they touch) and trying different session numbers til one works. E.G., log in at the beginning of the day, note the session number, wait for the victim to post a change to a ticket, log in again, check the session number, then try connecting with the victim's email address as Bugzilla_login, trying all session numbers between the later number and the earlier number as Bugzilla_logincookie, until one works.  On systems with fewer users (including high-profile projects like OpenSSH [bugzilla.mindrot.org]), the attack would be easier to accomplish.  Suggested improvements:  Option One (easiest to retrofit): shared secret.   Add another configuration variable (populated by a random value when Bugzilla is installed) for a site-wide shared secret. Set another cookie, Bugzilla_token, which is something like the hexadecimal MD5 or SHA hash of \"${sessionid}-${secret}-${logintime}\". (Might also want to add the User-Agent request header value sent by the browser used at login time. The login time is critical -- without login time, a user could brute-force the secret by looking at their own cookies, making the attack process trivially more complex [the attacker would only have to calculate the hash for each sessionid to be attempted].) The access control code would use Bugzilla_logincookie to find the user's time of login, to calculate the expected Bugzilla_token value. No match == security error message. Disadvantage: someone with read access (no write privileges needed) to the bugzilla server config could obtain the shared secret and use it to attack sessions  Option Two (preferred, requires database change): per-session random tokens  Add a third cookie, Bugzilla_token. Add a column to the session table, tokenhash. When a session is initiated, obtain\/generate some random data. Store a seeded MD5  or SHA hash of that data to the session table, and set the cookie to contain the hexadecimal representation of the data itself. The access control code would use Bugzilla_logincookie to find the salt for the stored hash, use the provided Bugzilla_token data to calculate the hash of the client-provided data with that salt, and see if the result matches the stored salted hash. No match == security error message. Advantage: an attacker would have to be able to control\/predict the random number generation to hijack a session. Disadvantage: would require modifications to database schema, making this improvment a more difficult upgrade for running sites to use.  Option Two Minus (secure but ugly hack): abusing database definitions  You could probably wedge the per-session salted hash described in Option Two inside some other column in the session table, e.g. in the userid\/email column store \"${saltedhash}\\t${email}\" and then parse them as needed. No database changes (== easy upgrades for running sites), but possibly gobs of code changes, and a really awful abuse of the database design.   Recommendation: Option One now, Option Two later  While not as strong as Option Two, Option One should dramatically improve the security of the cookie authentication mechanism, and would be an easy patch\/upgrade for current users. Option Two would be preferable in the long term, though.",

It states that the thread pane should just have summaries, and that when you click on one of them it should show just the article (without comments, headers etc.) in the default browser.   It displays the article in the message pane instead, changing the color of the summary to indicate its read. I have the message pane enabled because that is how I like to read email. I disabled the message pane and clicked on a different summary. That did literally nothing (doesn't display anything or mark it as read).   I right clicked on the same summary and chose \"Open message in new tab\" from the context menu. That opened a tab that displayed the article, and changed the summary to indicate it was read.  I'm not sure what the correct behavior is supposed to be. I don't think its as simple as the Litmus test case needs to be updated to replace \"viewing in the default browser\" with displaying it in Thunderbird because it never created a tab\/window unless I used the context menu, and most people don't enable the message pane.  I initially used http:\/\/planet.mozillamessaging.com\/rss20.xml when this problem occurred. I was able to read some articles that way but many took over 3 minutes to load, and never loaded the images. I did not have any problem or delay reading that blog entry using a browser.  Reselecting that article discarded the loaded article and started to load it again. It was very annoying to wait several minutes for less than 2 dozen lines of text on a DSL connection that consistently gets about 2514 Kbps (according to both the flash and java based speed tests at www.dslreports.com). I can't find any way to display the images. I tried right clicking on the image, selecting \"copy image\" and then pasting that into IrfanView. That pasted the URL instead. However, there were other articles where it displayed the images. When that happened right clicking on the image and selecting \"copy image\" did copy the image.  In general I found the RSS reader incredibly slow. Even when it worked it could take as long to fetch one article as it took a browser to open the complete blog page (52 articles). The only case where I found the performance not an issue was with http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/blog\/index.rdf , and its entire feed (of 5 articles) was about 30 lines of text and no images.",
