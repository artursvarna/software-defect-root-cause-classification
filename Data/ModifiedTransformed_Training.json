We're trying to use Bugzilla to track facility maintenance requests, so I created a create-facility.html.tmpl file, and added 3 fields to it (unit, permission, resident).  I also created a comment-facility.txt.tmpl file, but this is not being used.  Instead the generic comment.txt.tmpl file is being used instead.  This is a major problem for us, as we want to use one install of Bugzilla to track both maintenance and IS requests, and will need to have at least two different formats, and 2 different comment.txt.tmpl options.  Add the following line somewhere inside the form in create-facility.html.tmpl:  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"format\" value=\"facility\">  This passes the format parameter on to show_bug, which will then apply it to the comment to get comment-facility.txt.tmpl .

Please let me know if there\u2019s additional information that would be helpful.  **** HEADER INFO ****  Return-Path: bounce-2775_HTML-27847667-88854-1065730-0@bounce.e.mozilla.org Received: from zmmta2.mail.corp.phx1.mozilla.com (LHLO  zmmta2.mail.corp.phx1.mozilla.com) (10.20.77.30) by  zmmbox4.mail.corp.phx1.mozilla.com with LMTP;

(URL pasted below). &nbsp;This announcement demonstrates great momentum for the project and a groundswell of support in the industry for our efforts. &nbsp;I know this progress has taken tremendous energy from many of you and many throughout our community - thank-you! &nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Key highlights of this press release include the fact that we'll be using Firefox branding on this new mobile operating system (OS); the confirmation that we are on track with Telefonica, Qualcomm and the OEM partners to deliver the first devices in early 2013; and a number of new operator partners who are interested in supporting the Firefox OS at some point in the future.<br \/> <br \/> On the last item, please understand that this does not mean that all of the operators mentioned are committed to immediately delivering devices, but it does mean that we are in active discussions with them, and that they support our general strategic direction. It is important at this stage in our delivery that we not confuse the market by incorrectly stating the status of any of our partners or the delivery of various milestones of the project so I ask for your continued help to involve the project team and\/or the press team before you comment (tweet, blog, etc) publicly. &nbsp;We just want to make sure we all comment accurately. &nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> We have the opportunity to do something truly disruptive and positive for consumers and the mobile industry with the Firefox OS, just like we did with the Firefox browser on the desktop. I hope that you all share my enthusiasm and I thank you in advance for your continued hard work!<br \/>  <br \/> Best,<br \/> Gary Kovacs<br \/> <br \/><\/span><a   title=\" http:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/blog\/2012\/07\/02\/firefox-mobile-os\/\" href=\"http:\/\/click.e.mozilla.org\/?qs=ae279cd30b52a46d97cd94632e3425cf559b2ec92d88c808e9d8d54d28bcf26f\"> http:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/blog\/2012\/07\/02\/firefox-mobile-os\/<\/a><\/p>&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/td><\/tr><\/table>             <em>  You're receiving this email because you're a registered Mozillian.

        "FullDescription":"query.cgi?component= is not SELECTEDing the option,query.cgi component value does not reload form SELECTED itemOverview:  A bugzilla query.cgi URL including a value for the Component form control will generate a query page that *does not* have the SELECTED attibute on  any of the <OPTION>s of the <SELECT> NAMEd \"compoenent\". This mean that the resulting buglist will unexpectedly not be limited to matches to the  selected component.  Corresponding buglist.cgi URLs, including remembered queries, work as expected.  Steps to reproduce: 1. Click on the URL link above.  2. Observe the form. The FIXED resolution, the Webtools product,     and the Bonsai component should be SELECTED. 3. Click on Bonsai to select it. 4. Submit the form. 5. At the bottom of the buglist, click on the _Edit this query_ link. 6. Observe the form again. 7. Click the browser's [Back] button twice. 8. Observe the form again.  Expected Results: A. In steps 2, 6, and 8, the Component <SELECT> should have the \"Bonsai\"    <OPTION> SELECTED. B. If step 3 is left out, the buglist should contain only Bonsia bugs.  Actual Results: A. In steps 2, 6, and 8, the Component <SELECT> *does not* have the \"Bonsai\"    (or any) <OPTION> SELECTED. B. If step 3 is left out, the buglist will contain bugs from all Webtools    components.  Tested with: * Both bugzilla.mozilla.org and landfill.tequilarista.org * NN4.76, current Mozilla, and IE5.5 * Other Product\/Component pairs Same results on each trial.  Additional Information: This is a regression. It can cause a reasonably tightly crafted query.cgi URL stored as a bookmark or a link on a webpage to end up requesting a HUGE buglist if the user doesn't manually fix up the form before submitting it.  At the bottom of  http:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/quality\/help\/screening-duplicates.html there is a set of links to generate buglists for Browser-General bugs  submitted in the last week for all platforms, Linux-only, Mac-only,  and a final link called \/Customize\/ that is the same query as a query.cgi, so the user can, for instance, change the date range or put something in the Summary textbox. Right now, if the [Submit query] button is clicked, the buglist will contain *all* Browser product bugs submitted in the last week. Needless to say, before screening-duplicates.html went live all those links were tested and the buglist was limited to \"Browser-General\" as intended.",

I found the problem with version 12.0.1 (for Windows and Mac).  I tried Earlybird (14.0a2) for Windows but it was still broken.  I did the following steps: (Assume an (internal) SMTP server running services on standard port 25\/465\/587)  * Select Account Settings -> Account Actions -> Add Mail Account * Enter a name and Email address, and click \"Continue\" * Thunderbird found configuration by trying common server names * Click \"Manual config\" and change outgoing SSL setting from \"STARTTLS\" to \"SSL\/TLS\"   (The port number was automatically changed from 587 to 465) * Click \"Re-test\"   Actual results:  Thunderbird reported \"Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account\".  If I reverted outgoing SSL setting to \"STARTTLS\" and clicked \"Re-test\", Thunderbird reported \"The following settings were found by probing the given server\".  I'm sure that the server is configured correctly, because I could manually edit \"Outgoing Server (SMTP)\" in Account Settings to use \"SSL\/TLS\" for \"Connection security\" and send messages without problems.   Expected results:  Thunderbird should be able to find service on port 465 with SSL\/TLS by probing the given server. Actually, version 9.0.1 worked as expected, so it is a regression.  I captured packets between the client and server using wireshark, and noticed that Thunderbird didn't send SSL client hello to port 465 after 3-way handshake, and just closed the connection.  imaps (993) and pop3s (995) are detected properly.

Since the data directory was affected, this caused the params file to disapper, among others (collected stats, .htaccess files, ...). The missing params file caused all sorts of badness, most noticeably: Bugzilla displayed the mozilla banner instead of our own, all products were suddenly visible to everybody (since use*groups was suddently off), and the QA contact field was missing.   After I changed permission settings from 777 or 775 to 755 and permission settings from 666 or 664 to 644, this problem did not occur any more.

        "FullDescription":"clean up format ambiguitiesThe concept of formats is ambiguous because it represents two kinds of variations in appearance: structural (f.e. classic and modern versions of the query form) and representational (f.e. HTML and RDF versions of bug lists).  All structural variations *have* a representation (i.e. content type), but all representational variations *are* a representation, which leads to confusion about how users should request variations.  Structural and representational variations should be disambiguated from each other by distinguishing between the two in filenames and URL\/form parameters via the following scheme:  Variations in structure are called \"formats.\"  Each format has a unique name, and the name of a template file implementing a format consists of the name of the script (or equivalent identifier) followed by a dash, the format name, a period, the filename extension representing the format's content type, another period, and the \"tmpl\" extension, f.e.:   foo-classic.html.tmpl foo-modern.html.tmpl  Formats may be specified by users via the \"format\" URL\/form parameter.  Variations in representation are called \"content types.\"  Each content type has a unique extension, and the name of a template file implementing a content type consists of the name of the script (or equivalent identifier), followed by a period, the extension, another period, and the \"tmpl\" extension, f.e.:  bar.html.tmpl bar.xml.tmpl  Content types may be specified by users via the \"ctype\" URL\/form parameter.  Scripts may support both kinds of variations, in which case the \"format\" parameter takes precedence over the \"ctype\" parameter.  Scripts may not implement both kinds of variations in a single file, at least not until someone implements a data structure for storing variations that indexes them by both format name and extension (there is no need for this now, and it's unclear that there ever will be, but the scheme above does not do anything to prohibit its implementation if anyone ever discovers a reason to do it).  Bugzilla should fail gracefully when it cannot find the requested variation. Bugzilla should have ways for installations and users to specify default variations.",

Set up a new XMPP account in Thunderbird. 1.a. Use the format username@domain for the username. 1.b. Leave XMPP Options on default settings. 1.c. Uncheck \"Connect this account now.\" 2. Open the \"Instant messaging status\" window via Tools > Chat Status > Show Accounts... (or any other valid method). 3. Select the desired account. 4. Click the \"Connect\" button.     Actual results:  The status changes to \"Connecting\", followed shortly by \"Connecting: Initializing stream...\" that never seems to time out (left it open for at least 20 minutes).  Nothing is reported in the Error Console.   Expected results:  Thunderbird should connect to the chat account if connection is possible.  If connection is not possible, Thunderbird should produce useful and visible errors to the user to indicate a problem.   I do not have any proxies configured, so this shouldn't be related to bug 741536.  This is not a secure XMPP connection, so it shouldn't be bug 780749 or other related Self-Signed Certificate bugs.  I thought it might be a possible domain name mismatch between the username and the server (this is on shared web hosting), but even when I tried to adjust the settings for that, it would exhibit the same behavior described earlier.

        "FullDescription":"configurable index page [patch],configurable index page (using Template Toolkit)This is an enhancement request (with patch providing the functionality) to add a new 'index.cgi' script that can replace or supplement the existing index.html static html file.  By having the main index page be a cgi program rather than static html, we can take advantage of the configuration params (like bannerhtml) which makes it far easier for sites to customize the HTML associated with their deployed version of Bugzilla.  I will attach to this bug two files: a new \"index.cgi\" file, and a patch to the defparams.pl file that adds a new \"index-template\" param that contains the html to be displayed on the index page.  In addition, the attached index.cgi file can (optionally) display a table of the products that are part of this Bugzilla instance.  If that table is shown, the product names can optionally be links to a query for all of the bugs for that product.  These optional features are turned off by default in order to emulate the original behavior of Bugzilla as closely as possible.  Although this is not even close to a solution for separating UI from application logic, it does help a bit by making it easier to upgrade Bugzilla without having to reimplement HTML changes in the index.html file.  A solution more along the lines of Bug 49225 in which XML is converted to HTML using a user-specified set of XSLT stylesheets would be preferable but more disruptive to implement.

While that bug affects the attachment content, this bug mainly adds new information to the database that makes it possible to hide \"obsolete\" attachments. (Deletion of obsolete attachments could then be implemented later.)  Proposal: - If a bug has any attachments, there should be an additional link near \"Create a new attachment\" named \"Manage existing attachments\" (or perhaps \"Change\" or \"Edit\" instead of \"Manage\"). - Clicking on this link should describe the current possibilities to change attachments and display a list of all attachments with a checkbox next to each, similar to the \"My Bugs\" page (showvotes.cgi). A checked checkbox would mean the attachment is marked \"obsolete\". - Everyone with \"can edit all bugs\" permission should be able to toggle the \"obsolete\" switch and submit the change. The submitter of an attachment should have that permission, too. - In a bug view, only non-obsolete attachments should be shown by default. If there are obsolete attachments for a bug, an additional link should appear to show obsolete attachments, too. But even on that \"all attachments\" list, obsolete attachments should appear visually different from non-obsolete attachments. This could be done by applying a \"strike-through\" style to obsolete attachments. For a quick start, this page could be the same as the \"Manage attachments\" page. - Links like this: \"attachment 1234 [details]\" should have strike-through style iff the attachment is obsolete.  Implementing this would require an additional field to be added to the attachments table: attachment.isobsolete, probably similar to attachment.ispatch",

        "Description":"Support database transactions.,Implement database transactions across Bugzilla",
        "FullDescription":"Support database transactions.,Implement database transactions across BugzillaSpun off of bug #98304.  Some databases support the notion of transactions, where an operation is considered to be atomic.  Apparently PostgreSQL has good support for them - MySQL I believe supports them but not well.  Transactions have two main benefits that I see:  - When a transaction contains a write operation is occuring, all other transactions will see the database either as is was at the start, or as it was at the end.  Failures of any sort will not result in a \"corrupted\" database where half a transaction was applied.  Bug #104589 makes this problem serious, but even if we fix that transactions are still a good idea for robustness purposes.  Computers can crash and software can have bugs.  - Read-only operations should never be denied - they can always use the last copy of the database that was before any other transactions begun, which is guaranteed to be consistent by the definition of transactions.  This means the shadow database is unnecessary as a performance improvement.  I don't see that introducing transactions into the codebase would be very difficult.  The API should be rather simple.  You need the calls BeginTransaction, CommitTransaction.  A shorthand call PerformTransaction that performs a list of SQL statements would also be good when you know up front what you want to do.  Essentially I think we should be able to add these calls in a bit at a time.  If the database in use does not support transactions there is no great loss.  In this case the calls will essentially be no-ops and there is no loss over what we had before.  I don't provide a RollbackTransaction call for this reason - not all databases will support it and we must not expect them to.  I also think BeginTransaction and CommitTransaction provide another benefit - it is a nice solution to bug #104589, users closing the window shouldn't terminate scripts.  A script should NEVER terminate during a transaction.  We can implement this notion of \"transaction\" even in databases that don't support transactions.  Indeed, I'm not sure we need to prevent script termination outside of transactions at all.  There is also the issue of locking.  Write locks are still probably useful in databases with transactions - without them a transaction can fail because it clashes in the typical \"multiple writers\" situation, and the transaction would need to be reapplied.  We need to decide whether the complexity of retrying is better than the possibility of deadlocks that comes with locking.  The former could be hidden away in a call such as PerformTransaction, but would need to be considered for CommitTransaction.  Read locks are unnecessary for transactions in PostgreSQL, since it will maintain an old copy of the data for the reader.  So if a traditional read lock was done on such a database, it would block writers when there is no particular need to.  I'm not sure whether PostgreSQL would block writers or just ignore ignore the locks.  If the former, we need to make sure read locks are only done for non-transaction mode.  So the question here is essential, is locking something that BeginTransaction worries about?  If read locks would block writers, it needs to be, as it can decide whether to do the read locks.  If we want to do retrying sometimes instead of write locks, the same applies.  The locks could be passed as a parameter to BeginTransaction and it would decide what to do.  Unfortunately it isn't feasible for BeginTransaction to automatically compute what to lock at the start if necessary since it doesn't know what is going to happen in the transaction - PerformTransaction is not constrained in that way and so perhaps could.",

What is that? Page-down also has a down arrow! Oh, you mean \"cursor down\"? I think we are creating more problems than we're solving by using simplified language here (and elsewhere, needs a new bug). - Caveat1: Alt+Cursor down does NOT work as a general keyboard shortcut from the compose window for adding recipients; iow, from most parts of the UI, it does nothing. - Caveat2: Alt+Cursor down only ever works for the very specific scenario when you are *inside one of the recipient fields*, but then: - Caveat3: Even in the header, Alt+Cursor down does NOT *add* any recipients unless you happen to be in the *last* recipient; for any other recipient field, it's just \"*Move* to the next recipient\". - Caveat4: Alt+Cursor *up* is not even implemented (it probably should! needs a new bug), so what's the point of memorizing this? (btw, we should be more flexible for moving up between recipients...) - I doubt that anyone will ever need this, because it's far easier to use ENTER for almost exactly the same purpose (the only difference being that Alt+Cursor Down will preserve per-recipient selection of text, while ENTER or Tab, Tab, will select all of the recipient's text. But then, who really needs to preserve a previous *partial* selection of another recipient?)

Ideally, the memory cache should be large enough to keep a full message without having to consult the disk or the network again when revisiting it after a short visit to another message.  I've been using \"-1\" as default for SeaMonkey without seeing any issues with Mail\/News, and have tried both \"32768\" and \"-1\" on Thunderbird without any performance issues, however noticing a better performance with large messages when the disk cache is disabled.

We also are requiring the providers not to expire files, so that the e-mail recipients don't end up with stale links.  Risk: A \"surprise\" may manifest itself is when a user mis-forwards the message to the wrong party and the file can be downloaded by an unintended recipient. This can happen with the current set-up if a user forwards an attachment to the wrong party, and is a risk inherent in email.  An added risk of this system is that the file is publicly available and not limited in accessibility to those who can access the message itself. This is like 'security by obscurity', which is not ideal, but acceptable in this case since users know the file will be uploaded to a sharing service.

I finally figured out the problem today, the browser elements created by specialTabs.js end up with the disablehistory attribute set on them. I have a workaround but it looks to me like this is a mistake caused by the landing of bug 677421.  That patch is too big for me to want to spend anytime trying to figure out exactly what the expectation is of these things, but here are two anomalies I can see that are likely bugs:  The overlay attempts to modify the dummycontentbrowser that all content browsers are cloned from to enable history by setting the disablehistory attribute to false. The problem is that that won't work, if the disablehistory attribute exists at all then history is disabled no matter its value. http:\/\/hg.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/annotate\/b438e21e3c6b\/mail\/base\/content\/webSearchTab.xul#l53  As far as I can tell this should be unnecessary anyway as the specialTabs code removes the disablehistory attribute on startup before any new content tabs are created (http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mail\/base\/content\/specialTabs.js#500), this used to work fine but unfortunately bug 677421 also introduced a second element with the id \"dummycontentbrowser\" and it is this element that is now returned by getElementById(\"dummycontentbrowser\") so it is that that gets its dummycontentbrowser attribute removed instead. http:\/\/hg.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/annotate\/b438e21e3c6b\/mail\/base\/content\/webSearchTab.xul#l71  My best guess without really knowing what the rest of the OpenSearch code is up to is that renaming that new browser element to have a unique ID and removing the attempt to modify disablehistory from webSearchTab.xul should just make everything work.",

If there is now emailOwnerRemoveme for a particular user, it should default to sending mail (the checkbox is checked in editprefs.cgi).  While this logic may seem backwards, it allows the amount of data stored to be much smaller (an entry in the table is only created if a user doesn't want mail, if the later decide they do want mail on that type of change, simply remove the row from the table).",

        "FullDescription":"ConnectToDatabase misuse,ConnectToDatabase misuse - partial fix for 2.16We call ConnectToDatabse() in a whole lot of places. Instead, we should only do so at the top of scripts. Currently, we have the problem noted on landfill where if you try to enter a bug when you're not logged in, and we're scheduled rebuild the versioncache, then we clear the token table first. Rebuilding the versioncache calls ConnectToDB, and if you're logged in with a non-0 groupset we call userInGroup, which also connects to the db.  The token code doesn't, and so we fail when making a db query to do the updates  This is thus a 2.16 blocker.  The easy solution is just to always connectToDatabase at the top of scripts, and never anywhere else. This will cause a sperious connection on pages which don't otherwise need the versioncache, when a person isn't logged in (wince then we wouldn't need them for the footer, either). I think that the product selection part of enter_bug.cgi is the only one of those we have, so I think we can live with that...  This blocks the replication bug, bug 124589, because there I've changed ConnectToDatabase() to mean 'connect to the real db' instead of the current behaviour of returning if we already have a connection. Yes, I could make ConnectoToDatabase with no args only connect if we're not connected, but I think that its easier to just remove the calls from helper functions, which are scattered thoguhtout the code, as seen from the current issue with enter_bug.

However, since mysql won't replicate between two servers on the same port, we need to allow for the shadowdb and the real db to be on different servers\/ports. We should also support different sockets, otherwise mysql will ignore the port and use the default socket for localhost (which would be the wrong one).  This means an extra (optional) param in localconfig for the main db, and params for host\/port\/socket path for the shadow stuff, and the appropriate code to open a second db connection if required.  syncshadowdb would be removed, and the shadowlog table dropped from the db.  Docs describing this would also be added.  Note that this is obviously post-2.16. However, supporting the shadowdb post-pgsql and transaction support is likely to mean a lot of pain. MattyT pointed out that we'd need to obsolete this before removing it. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the case, though - we plan on upping the mysql requirements for 2.18 anyway, and the shadowlog isn't exactly the most reliable part of bugzilla anyway.

        "FullDescription":"processmail doesn't work with the P4DTIBACKGROUND  The Perforce Defect Tracking Integration <http:\/\/www.ravenbrook.com\/project\/ p4dti\/> integrates Bugzilla with the Perforce software configuration management  system.  It replicates bugs between Bugzilla and Perforce so that users of  Perforce can see and edit their bugs, and relate bugs to source changes.  When someone changes a bug in Perforce, the P4DTI updates the bug in Bugzilla.   It then needs to send e-mail notifications, which it does by running the Bugzilla  processmail script.  DEFECT DESCRIPTION  When the P4DTI runs the processmail script from Bugzilla 2.14, no e-mail is sent.   Instead, the following error message appears in the standard error:  Insecure $ENV{BASH_ENV} while running with -T switch at .\/processmail line 745 \\ (#1)      (F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or     setgid script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS}, $ENV{CDPATH},     $ENV{ENV} or $ENV{BASH_ENV} are derived from data supplied (or     potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a     known value, using trustworthy data.  See perlsec.  REPRODUCING THIS BUG  You probably don't want to install the P4DTI in order to confirm this bug.   Instead, run Bugzilla in an environment where some of the dangerous environment  variable have values.  You'll see that processmail doesn't send e-mail.  DIAGNOSIS  The processmail script is invoking the shell in order to open a pipe to sendmail.   It does so with taint mode turned on (-T option to perl) but without clearing the  dangerous environment variables.  SOLUTION  Clear the dangerous environment variables, as recommended in the perlsec manpage,  by running        delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};  before invoking the shell.  I added this line to my processmail script and the P4DTI was then able to send e- mail notifications.  OTHER NOTES  Why doesn't this bug show up in normal operation?  Perhaps because Bugzilla  always runs in an environment where the dangerous environment variables aren't  set (e.g., in Apache under user \"nobody\").  This is related to bug 59349.",

However, for some reason the unit tests require it, and since we'll be getting it anyway, I think we should just pick it up.

Because context menu relies on window.getSelection() for its Search engine context menu, the context menu breaks.  The bug is two-fold.  Bugzilla should not use getSelection or any other names such as this, and Mozilla should either prevent getSelection from being modified by code like this, or not break when this happens.

Actually, I just realized that MultiMessageSummary assumes that the right URL is loaded in the multimessage pane, and proceeds without even checking that multimessageview.xhtml is actually loaded.  What I did was make a monkey-patch on top of the summarizeMultipleSelection function that first restores the right url before handing control flow over the original summarizeMultipleSelection once multimessageview.xhtml is loaded.  I think the original implementations of summarizeThread and summarizeMultipleSelection should take care of this. I don't think this is just a case of \"patch Thunderbird to suit my needs\", because I'm pretty sure the extension that does account summary and folder summary has to workaround this too, and this might simplify its life if it could just assume that whenever someones actually needs to display something in the multimessage pane, then that someone takes care of having the right URL loaded.  davida, mixedpuppy, thoughts?

        "FullDescription":"Crash exporting messages in HTML format with ImportExportToolsUser Agent: Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.9.2.21) Gecko\/20110830 Firefox\/3.6.21 Build ID: 20110830092825  Steps to reproduce:  I'm the developer of ImportExportTools extension. Many users wrote to me, about a crash they get when trying to export messages in HTML format. The crash happens after a random number of messages and just with Thunderbird 5 or higher. All my reports come from Windows or MAC users and I can't reproduce this bug in any way on my Linux machine.  Crash logs (I've just few) have all many references to  \"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\mswsock.dll\" , you can find it a couple here:  http:\/\/services.gxware.org\/nopaste\/?3673 http:\/\/services.gxware.org\/nopaste\/?3674  All crash reports I got, seem to fall into this crash:   https:\/\/crash-stats.mozilla.com\/report\/list?product=Thunderbird&query_search=signature&query_type=exact&query=XPC_WN_NoHelper_Finalize&reason_type=contains&date=10%2F07%2F2011%2001%3A14%3A11&range_value=1&range_unit=weeks&hang_type=any&process_type=any&do_query=1&signature=XPC_WN_NoHelper_Finalize  All users report that crash happens just exporting in HTML\/plain-text format, but not in EML format. The code for export in HTML is very similar to the code for export in EML.  The only difference is that EML export is done just through with a simple call to   messengerService.streamMessage(msguri, myEMLlistner, msgWindow, null, false, null);  while HTML export is performed with  var nschannel =  Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org\/network\/input-stream-channel;1\"]    \t  .createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIInputStreamChannel); nschannel.setURI(nsURI); var streamConverterService = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org\/streamConverters;1\"]    \t   \t  .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIStreamConverterService); var streamListner=streamConverterService.asyncConvertData(\"message\/rfc822\", \"text\/html\", myTxtListener, nschannel); messageService.streamMessage(uri, streamListner, msgWindow, null, false, null);\t\t  The rest of the code is pretty identical, so I guess that the crash is caused by nschannel.setURI(nsURI) or by the asyncConverter.  Notice that it seems have a close relation with https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=682916, so this crash could be a symptom of a very frequent problem, present also on Firefox.  Steps to reproduce:  - install ImportExportTools extension, version 2.6.2.2 (attached here) - try to export a large number of messages in HTML format, with Thunderbird 5 or higher - after a random number of messages, sometimes you'll get a crash of Thunderbird  I'm contact with some users that can help us and me to debug this problem, so tell me which tests can be useful.",

I propose we do the following, in broad strokes:  1) When a failure is reported, gather information about the state of Thunderbird:  a) Always gather some data that can't hurt.  For example, render a canvas-based screenshot of each window and characterize broad UI state (what window is focused, what widget in that window is focused, high-level tab info which may not be obvious from the screenshot).  b) Provide \"event timeline\" data for the time period shortly before the start of the test up through declaration of the failure.  The canonical example of such events is folderEventLogHelper.js which provides an nsIMsgFolderListener and reports everything it hears using logHelper's mark_action.  This data would normally be written into an in-memory buffer and discarded in cases where a test does not fail.  c) Provide hooks for specific tests\/test families to provide additional information.   2) \"Report\" that information by either writing it to a file or printing it out on stdout.  The stdout idea is for tinderbox.  We can scrape the data out of the buildlog after the fact and do something useful with it without first having to stand up a reliable fancy data store.

        "FullDescription":"Bug changes with intermediate pages munges fields with multiple values (e.g., CC)Sometimes, when changing a bug, Bugzilla has to display an intermidiate page.  Examples include specifying the component\/version\/milestone when a product is changed, the user logging in, resolving \"mid-air collisions\", and confirming duplicates.  In that intermediate page, Bugzilla needs to save the changes the user wanted to make.  However, for fields with multiple values, e.g., the CC lists, these values are munged.  All the values are concatenated together into one value.  To see this in action, take a bug with CCs.  Change the product and remove a couple of CCs at the same time, so you get the \"verify component\/version\/milestone\" page.  Once you specify these values, you get an error, because \"user1@domain.comuser2@domain.netuser3@example.org\" is not a registered Bugzilla account.  Note that this was noticed in bug 101056.  But it was only noticed and fixed for the case where this user has to log in before committing his change.  It still exists in the other cases.

The new theme on windows 7 somewhat exacerbates this.  I don't think I even noticed on the old theme.  The separator between panes (between the message list, a message, or the folder list) appears as only one pixel wide;  I believe the click-able area of the separator may be wide (maybe just 2) but it's hard to say for sure.  The usual method of telling is that the cursor will change to a two-headed arrow, but that is not working most of the time.  Probably most of the time, there is some pending command submitted to the email server (this may be an unrelated problem but it's certainly commonplace in my experience), so instead of showing the two-headed arrow, it only shows the wait indicator (pointer + spinny thing, as opposed to just the large spinny thing).

Solution: This occurs because relogin.cgi calls delete $::COOKIE{\"Bugzilla_login\"}; after  calling PutHeader (\"Relogin\"); This means that the call to quietly_check_login () within GetCommandMenu() returns 1, and GetCommandMenu() displays the Log Out  option.

I have not actually tried it to see if Bugzilla actually allows it, (didn't want to upset people).  Here are the options I have now for a bug I reported (such as Bug 148881): Leave as UNCONFIRMED  Confirm bug (change status to NEW) Accept bug (confirm bug, change status to ASSIGNED) Resolve bug, changing resolution to Resolve bug, mark it as duplicate of bug # Reassign bug to      and confirm bug (change status to NEW) Reassign bug to owner of selected component      and confirm bug (change status to NEW)   Apologies if I am misremebering (and this is not a regression after all).

I also understand the notion that users ought to be able to reopen bugs they reported, mark their own reports duplicates of others, and so forth, but I am pretty sure this does not fall under \"so forth\".

This allows us to detect the timeout and throw a potentially richer and more detailed error with mark_failure, e.g. at <https:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mail\/test\/mozmill\/shared-modules\/test-folder-display-helpers.js#1644>.  With MozMill 1.5, waitForEval throws a canned exception on timing out. While this is great for detecting bugs, it is somewhat less so for seeing exactly what went wrong. The alternative is to use waitFor and pass in a string, but that doesn't directly allow printing the state of something after it's timed out, just an effectively static string.  One way to fix this seems be to wrap the data in an object which when toString() is called does whatever mark_failure does, and pass this object in as the second argument to waitFor.

Specific dates do not work nearly as well as relative dates for many queries,    especially for canned queries that are bookmarked or put in a webpage. 2. Limiting a query to bugs that are new in the last \"n\" days is a very useful     way to cut a result set down to size when hunting for an existing report of     a regression when you can't be sure that the regression happened today. 3. For people who live halfway around the globe or even just a few timezones     away, the \"View Bugs Already Reported Today\" link on Mozilla's Bugzilla    is nowhere near as useful for finding reports of regressions in the current    nightly as a canned query that would look for bugs reported today \/and\/    yesterday. 4. Previously the \"Changed in the last __ days\" field could be used in     conjunction with any of the \"Where the field(s)\" items to search,    for instance, for bugs whose resolution has changed in the last week.  ... and an observation:   The \"Changed in the last __ days\"  field still works as expected when the \"Where the field(s)\" field is empty -- presumably it still does when that field isn't empty, but the \"\" in the \"dates ___\" field equating to today is further limiting the search so you'd never know.  Personally, I wouldn't mind if this functionality was moved to the boolean chart part of the form, even though it would not be as clear ( [bug creation] [ <= ] [2] ), but specific date searching just can't do all the work that relative date searching can do.  If \"\" in the \"dates ___\" field is equating to today, that is a bug -- empty fields should not limit a search at all.",

It was interpreted as a \"\" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.     To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.          To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells you what operation     you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your     program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily     appear literally in your program.  For example, \"that $foo\" is     usually optimized into \"that \" . $foo, and the warning will refer to     the concatenation (.) operator, even though there is no . in your     program.

When the selector is focused, currently pressing enter starts the edit of the status message. Shouldn't the down arrow open the status type popup menu? - After finishing to edit the status message, there's no focused element in the document any more (pressing the tab key does nothing); I think we need a focus call, like the one we have when finishing the rename of a contact. - When the status type is \"Offline\", the status message isn't editable, so we shouldn't display the textbox border while hovering it.  This does all the things listed in comment 0 + disables the \"Show Accounts\" button of the chat toolbar if there's no account. The \"Get started\" button in the middle of the main part of the chat tab in that case is much more visible, and opens directly the account wizard instead of the accounts status dialog which could be confusing when there's no account (it's not broken though).",

I would like to know what the best approach would be: make it a .cgi file and generate the JS component arrays on the fly, or make it the responsability of the including file (possibly a template) to generate them?",

We reduced it down to one main issue, and one minor issue that we want to follow-up on as well (plus one issue already fixed):  * The main issue is that the account provisioning providers are being talked to in an synchronous fashion. At the moment, hover is taking about 7.5 - 8.5 seconds to respond, gandi is between 1 - 4 seconds.  Thunderbird has a built in timeout of 10 seconds.  Hence, there are various times when we're taking up to about 11\/12 seconds to get a result, and so Thunderbird is timing out. I'm guessing about 30 - 50% of the time we could be getting timeouts at the moment. We have no history here, so we don't know how long we've been in this state.  Sancus is planning on changing broker-live to run the providers as async (something that was originally intended), so once that is done, we should be a lot less likely to time out.  * The minor issue, is that broker-live also has a 10 second timeout on individual results, given that Thunderbird also has 10 seconds, that leaves no time for actual processing in the server picks up the timeout case, i.e. we could be in the state where a provider has timed out, but another provider has returned the results which broker-live would return, but Thunderbird would itself have timed out leaving the user with no results.  The simple fix here is to bump Thunderbird's timeout a little, so that it exceeds broker-live's timeout.  Given the times we're seeing for results to be returned on individual providers, I don't think we need to push this tweak out quick for 17.0, we can include it in the next round of security releases, as an worst case improvement.  * The fixed issue is that when requesting results for only one provider, broker-live was still asking both\/all providers (in the synchronous fashion as mentioned above).  This is now fixed on broker-live and, for instance, we're generally seeing 1-3 seconds on results from Gandi where it was around 10 seconds (and sometimes timing out) before.    So at the moment, searches on individual providers should now return results all of the time, and searches on both providers may time out - but Sancus will look at fixing that later today.",

It's used in two places:  * nsHTMLEditor::InsertAsPlaintextQuotation()   if somehow set True, puts reply-quotes inside a <pre> rather than    a <span> in the plain-text editor.  No visible effect in the compose window,   but requires an extra rule in HTML.CSS to colorize the pre[_moz_quote].  * nsPlainTextSerializer::Write()   if True, may cause a bypass of the \"no intelligent wrapping\" section of the   DOM-to-Text conversion of the plain-text editor's buffer into a message,   thereby preventing quotes from being wrapped -- the same behavior seen when   the pref is turned off and the quote is contained within a <span>.  The pref is set to False by default; I seriously doubt anyone still uses this for anything.  I gather it was desirable when there was some other, harder-to-deal-with problem in the editor's behavior within a <pre>, but that's obsolete now.

I was trying to use these on the try server to help, but the failures didn't actually happen on the try server for the two pushes I performed (with some minor logging changes between the two).  This either means my logging changes alter timing enough to stop the intermittent oranges, or there is some horrible subtle difference between the try runs and the non-try runs.  (Packages tests versus non-packaged?)  One thing made obvious to me is I'm not sure how to make buildbot just re-run unit tests.  I have access to the admin variant, but all I could see was a way to order it to do a complete rebuild of a push.  I told it to do that for one of the linux builders, but since I haven't seen the results show up yet, I presume it did not work right.  Or I killed buildbot, because I can't get it to respond right now so I can see the buildbot waterfall instead of depending on tinderbox.   Logging improvements:  - Better identify windows by more consistently reporting their window type and by tagging all windows with unique integers that we report.  - Introduced a \"b\" class of logging for \"winhelp\" and \"fdh\" for boring events.  This is really just a presentation thing that's the lesser evil versus complicating the client side a lot more at this point.  - Map keyCode values to VK_CONSTANTS and show charCodes as actual characters for keypress events.  - Log window activation\/deactivation.  (Note: only happens once we augment the windows.  The resulting event stream for when a new window shows up tends to be: \"window we know about deactivates\", \"we augment the new window\", \"we hear about the new window deactivating in favor of some other window we already knew about\".    I tried to hook us up during the onOpenWindow event, but could not readily poke our unique id anywhere and do not believe the blind spot is large enough to justify figuring out how to actually make that work at this time.)",

I am in the process of implementing (hacking, really) the following changes...  #1 is nearly done and will soon have a patch (my first) for the whole world to throw rocks at.  #2 is in planning.  Beyond that is more sketchy.  1) New parameter - \"insidergroup\" naming a group whose members are considered insiders.  Members of this group can mark any comment private.  Comments marked private will not be visible to any user not part of \"insidergroup\" and email notifications to non-insiders will be supressed when the associated comment is private. (for simplicity, auto-generated comments about duplicate bugs and attachments are  considered private -- this may change later)  2) New attribute of a project -- \"inside\"     If a project is flagged as \"inside\" then no non-insiders may edit any bugs while they are in that project, even if the bug is public and\/or they are on the CC list.   If a project is non-\"inside\", then all bugs in that project will be forced to be in that project's group.  3) Limit visibility of email addresses and assignees by non-insiders.

The webserver gets this by doing a reverse DNS lookup. Therefore an attacker which can provide reverse dns for their IP can bypass the IP address checks by providing the hostname of the user they want to spoof.   Hostname lookups are disabled by default in apache, so this won't affect most people, which is why if you look at your logincookies table you'll see ip addresses. Its still an attack, though, and should be fixed for 2.16.  I've been looking for an excuse to get bug 20122 in for 2.16, and since fixing this bug is about 2\/3 of the work I'll use this. ;)  An open question which I was thinking about before I realised the security issues: REMOTE_ADDR can be ipv4 or ipv6. If its ipv4, then the field is set to varchar(15) NOT NULL (or int4 NOT NULL) and we're done. If its ipv6, the field has to be larger. (I don't plan on supporting the netmask stuff for ipv6).

(Other implementation options include - the page parameter being a full template path; but this allows people to display arbitrary templates, so is probably a bit insecure - the page parameter being a full template name, and the templates always being in one particular directory. This avoids the above problem, but may stop you putting your template with associated other templates in the filesystem.)",

We have a piece of software that creates automatic email messages.  One piece of bad behavior from this software is that it apparently inserts a plain comma, all by itself, in the CC field.  (This is a bit of sloppiness in the handling of multiple CC recipients that is being addressed in that software).  Nonetheless, it exposed a nasty bug in Thunderbird that does not manifest in other email clients.  When you are reading a mail message (particularly in the three-pane window) that has a CC field with just a single comma in it, you get the following behavior:  1) In the bottom view pane, Thunderbird always \"fills in\" the recipients that were CC'ed on the last message you read before this one.  They're not really there (as one can confirm from Viewing Message Source), but it's jarring nonetheless.  2) There's often the same effect with the Subject line - in the bottom view pane, it replaces the legitimate Subject line of the email you're viewing with the Subject line of your last viewed message.  Looking at the View Message Source, I see that the Subject line is right after the CC line.  So you might have something like this in the source:  CC: , SUBJECT: Real subject line here  ... but it displays in the bottom pane as:  from (correct sender) subject (wrong subject from previous message) to (you) cc (people from previous message)   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Not sure how to create what is clearly a malformed email (with CC: ,) ... but if you can, you'll see what I'm talking about.  If you need me to forward you such a message, give me an email to shoot it to.  Because of course, when I try to make the well-behaved Thunderbird message creation window do this, it won't.

(We can't look up a user's password in LDAP;  they'd need to contact  an LDAP administrator for that.)

Actual results:  When trying to send e-mail I received this error:  \"Sending of message failed. Unable to open the temporary file \/path\/to\/the\/file.png. Check your 'Temporary Directory' setting.\"  When investigating the error I have noticed one thing. The file .png that I have attached to the message was gone from the hard drive.

I tried different files with different extensions. Makes no difference. If You cancel sending the message and the message contains attachment the attached file will get deleted from hard drive...

It adds a \"Chat\" tab to address book cards, where it's possible to set a username for: Google Talk, AIM, Yahoo, Skype, QQ, MSN, ICQ, Jabber. In the first (\"Contact\") tab, the old Screen Name field is gone, and at the same place there's a \"Chat information\" link that when clicked selects the \"Chat\" tab.  Requesting feedback from Blake (to check that the UI is what he expects) and David (to check that the way this touches the address book code isn't going to cause significant pains).   David, I saw that all the current fields are listed at http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mailnews\/addrbook\/public\/nsIAbCard.idl#365 Do I need to add all the new IM fields in that list? I don't have a clear understanding of how this list is needed.  * I won't pretend to understand all the usages of kScreenNameProperty, except http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mailnews\/addrbook\/src\/nsAbAddressCollector.cpp#278 (and we can probably do the same for @gmail.com @googlemail.com, @hotmail, @msn, and @live addresses)  * Are AIM screen names stored in ldap? http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mailnews\/mailnews.js#311 Do we need something similar for other IM services?  * I also noticed http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/comm-central\/source\/mailnews\/addrbook\/src\/nsAbOSXUtils.mm#136 that seems to be using Apple-defined constants to import things from the OS X address book. There are more similar constants documented at https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/#documentation\/UserExperience\/Reference\/AddressBook\/C\/ABPersonRef\/Reference\/reference.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/c_ref\/kABAIMInstantProperty and apparently OS X 10.7 supports even more: https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/#documentation\/UserExperience\/Reference\/AddressBook\/C\/ABPersonRef\/Reference\/reference.html#\/\/apple_ref\/c\/data\/kABInstantMessageServiceAIM   Blake, the current address book shows the Screen Name in the card summary that's visible in the bottom part of the address book window when selecting a card. Do we need to change this to show all the IM fields that have a value?  There's currently an \"Instant Message\" context menu items on contacts (and it's also a toolbar button; hidden by default though) that just takes the AIM screen name and loads an aim:goim?screenname=<screenname> url through the external protocol service. I assume we want to change that, but what's the new expected behavior? Do we take into account which accounts the user has configured? The presence information we have of the contact? I don't think there's a known typical URL for all the IM services I have listed in the new \"Chat\" tab that this patch adds.",

        "FullDescription":"Simplify and improve the stored query mechanismSeveral things (e.g. bug 179281) have suggested to me that the UI associated with named queries needs an overhaul. Here are my suggestions. The aims of this change are as follows:  - Simplify the UI on the search page - Reduce the number of links in the footer, which gets bloated with lots of   queries - Make manipulating stored queries easier to understand - Avoid making them harder to use for an expert  As now, we need to be able to create them, run them, load them and forget them.  Creating and deleting them happens on buglist.cgi, at the bottom of the page:  ( Remember ) this search as: [         ] or instead, if you've just run a stored query: _Forget_ | _Edit_ this search \"AssignedToMe\"  Running them is always done from a dropdown list in the footer:  ... | ( Find ) bug # [      ] | ( Run ) search [ AssignedToMe |V] | ...  If JS is turned on, the search runs when you choose an option from the list, and Run is not a button.  The word \"search\" could be hyperlinked, replacing the current \"Query\" link, if that wasn't thought too confusing. The \"edit\" links would be a dropdown too.  query.cgi's knob would then be vastly simplified to:  ( Search )    [ ] and remember these as my default search options  Other changes: \"My Bugs\" becomes a default entry in the stored queries table, inserted at account creation time, instead of being hard-coded.  All queries appear in the footer, the links toolbar, and nowhere else, so linkinfooter goes away, along with its UI on userprefs.cgi.  Results: - No loss of function - Confusion about doing an action _and_ running the search is avoided - Queries are as easy to run as before (one click with JS) - Footer is simpler - Search page knob is much simpler - User preferences are simpler - Admin config is a bit simpler (mybugslink goes) - You can refine a search, and then remember it on the results page when it's   correct",

This has been happening on 2 machines over multiple OS and Thunderbird installs, folder rebuilds, etc.  Reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Delete a few messages in fairly rapid succession (usually a second apart or less), using the Delete key in the message list pane. 2. Move selection to a different message before Thunderbird is finished resolving the corresponding IMAP transactions, or as happened today, click the close button on an open message tab. Actual Results:   Thunderbird trashes or even deletes (which was _not_ the original action) some additional messages without being asked to.  And yes, I keep count of how many times I press Delete, so I'm getting n+1 deletions.  Expected Results:   My mail is where I left it, unmolested.  A couple of other vaguely-related bits of weird UI and IMAP behaviour which -may- point to architectural issues behind this: (I'll file these as their own bugs eventually but for now they're quite possibly relevant to the overwhelmingly more important issue here)  - Nondeterministic UI behaviour:  Quite frequently, closing a message tab, then quickly using cmd-1 to get back to the Inbox (or otherwise), will result in what appears to be the message preview pane appearing below the message list (I normally have it turned off), but it is NOT checked in the View > Layout menu.  Additionally, if I then go and turn it on, it changes appearance somewhat (thus \"what appears to be\").  - Weird, probably overly-complicated management of folder actions:  Selecting a group of messages and pressing 'm' to toggle their read\/unread status will result in them flipping back and forth to read\/unread status a couple of times (I believe it's usually 2-3 transitions total, when one would expect one transition from a sane piece of software).  - Often, using cmd-z to move a message back from the trash will result in the message coming back, and then disappearing a few seconds later.  I don't do this often enough to remember whether it goes back to the trash consistently or sometimes ends up deleted.",

Happens only on Thunderbird 11 and later, since the SummaryFrameManager landed in Thunderbird 11.  - Install Conversations (http:\/\/jonathan.xulforum.org\/files\/gcv-nightlies\/, just grab the latest file) and Mail Summaries (latest version on AMO). - View a message in the conversation view. - Click the \"Delete\" button in the conversation toolbar (rightmost button). - The conversation view is in a bad state (unable to recover unless you switch folders or select multiple messages) and the folder summary is in a bad state too.  I hunted it down to the following line: if I add a dump statement like so in summaryFrameManager.js:87        this.iframe.contentDocument.location.href = aUrl;       dump(\"--- -> now is \"+this.iframe.contentDocument.location.href+\" \"+aUrl+\"\\n\");  Then the code dumps:  --- -> now is chrome:\/\/conversations\/content\/stub.xhtml chrome:\/\/mailsummaries\/content\/folderSummary.xhtml  That is to say, right after we set the .href to \"folderSummary.xhtml\", its value still is \"stub.xhtml\". What happens next is the conversation view kicks back in to grab the multimessage. Because the old \"stub.xhtml\" value is still held in \".href\", the FrameManager thinks everything is fine, and instructs the conversation view to proceed (because the document currently loaded is the right one). Next thing we know, loading folderSummary.xhtml *actually* happens, but: - the folderSummary callback was cancelled by the conversation view's - the conversation view's callback fails miserably because, of course, the loaded document is not the right one.

If this all seems like too much trouble, you can set this paramater to be the empty string, which will cause the graphing feature to be disabled entirely.\" 5) There may be some need to explain the means by which dependancy graphs can now be generated: \"It is possible to show graphs of dependent bugs. You may set this parameter to any of the following: <ul> <li>A complete file path to 'dot' (part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphviz.org\">GraphViz<\/a>) will generate the graphs locally.<\/li> <li>A URL prefix pointing to an installation of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.research.att.com\/~north\/cgi-bin\/webdot.cgi\">webdot package<\/a> will generate the graphs remotely.<\/li> <li>A blank value will disable dependency graphing.<\/li> <\/ul> The default value is a publically-accessible webdot server.",

Exiting and starting thunderbird again does not help: the pane is empty and the folder structure is not displayed.  I found two ways to circumvent the problem and see the folder structure again: a) use the right arrow button above the (empty) folder list and select anything except \"All Folders\". E.g. select \"Unread Folders\", or \"Recent Folders\", ... If then th. is restarted, the folder list is displayed again. b) the error only occurs if th. is closed when a scrollbar is available (folder list is too long to fit into the pane, i. e. the structure is expanded to show some sub folders). Therefore a workaround is to shrink the list by de-expanding sub structures so far that no scrollbar is needed. Then you can safely close thunderbird. Upon next start, the pane shows the structure.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.expand folder list in folder pane so far, that a scrollbar appears because the list is too long to fit into the pane 2.restart thunderbird 3.folder pane is empty (see Details) Actual Results:   Folder pane is empty  Expected Results:   Folder pane displays the folder structure of my email accounts  My folder pane contains the structure (Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent, Junk, Trash,and some more names with sub folders) for 4 different email accounts plus some news servers. So it is quite long and if some folders are expanded to show the sub folders, I usually have a scrollbar and the problem occurs.

Steps to Reproduce:  -- Well don't bother reproducing it, but what I did was ...  1) I was changing the Product for a bug while adding comments, etc.,    which then sent me to the page for selecting component\/milestone\/version.   2) This is done by using GET's to maintain the state across the pages    (i.e., encoding state in the URL).  3) I was also adding a couple of stack traces inline with my other    comments and changes.  Actual Results:   Apache returned an error for 'URI too long' (not an exact quote)  Expected Results:   Successfully complete the update (although I don't really expect   this given the situation)  Reproducibility: well, in this case, always, but it's a special case.  Additional Information:  You can resolve this as wontfix if you like. I realize that avoiding  this limit would mean some significant changes to Bugzilla. If anything, probably better to just detect this situation before it happens, and  give a more graceful message to the end user.

At the same time, we'll fix some confusing inconsistencies and bugs in the current *zoom* vs. *change font size* UI\/behaviour for composition, like bug 512968. I have recently documented the current confusion in Keyboard Shortcuts Article (1), so I know what I am talking about...  For easy reading, I'll refer to windows keyboard shortcuts only. You'll can easily work out equivalents for other OS from Keyboard Shortcuts (1).

Bug 449299 (compose in a tab) will make this even more confusing. Having different keyboard shortcuts for zoom in reader vs. composition  violates ux-consistency, and should be changed (ux-error-prevention).  2b zoom *keyboard+mouse*: Ctrl+mouse wheel (ok); but practically no reliable way of resetting zoom to 100%, bug 512968.  2c zoom *mouse only*: not possible  For people who need and use both: changing font size and zooming simultaneously, current UI\/behaviour is ultimate confusion as we don't have any indication of the current zoom level nor any reliable way to reset it to 100% except guessing from sight (bug 512968). Try guessing 100% zoom for an increased font size...  Expected result (changes\/improvements proposed by this bug):  * be ux-consistent * be accessible * be feature-complete  2a) *keyboard only* - use the same zoom keyboard shortcuts for composition as in message reader (and FF), especially when we can compose in a tab, bug 449299: Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0 to zoom in\/out\/reset (anywhere); this will fix bug 512968. - implement new, distinct keyboard shortcuts for changing font size: Ctrl+> to increase font size Ctrl+< to decrease font size (and optionally, Ctrl+= to reset font size without resetting other text styles; otherwise there's Ctrl+Space to reset \/all\/ text styles incl. font size).  2b) *keyboard+mouse*  - basically, we're fine here, if we do 2a which will fix bug 512968. - optionally, consider adding a mouse+keyboard shortcut for resetting the zoom to 100%, so we could have: Ctrl+mouse wheel up\/down: zoom in\/out Ctrl+middle click (click on mouse wheel): reset zoom to 100% (or even toggle between 100% and the last custom zoom level).  2c) *mouse only* For full mouse-only access: - Add View > Zoom menu to composition window, same as message reader (easy, should be fixed in a separate bug)  (1) https:\/\/support.mozillamessaging.com\/en-US\/kb\/keyboard-shortcuts",

Our current mechanism of writing variables to localconfig doesn't allow us to change the comments on a variable that's already in localconfig.  Changing the default comment only changes the comment on a config that hasn't picked up that variable yet.  The best way to do this is to read in the file, add any defaults that are missing, in memory, then re-write the entire file out with all of the default comments (instead of just appending the new ones to the end).  Need to make sure it's documented at the top of the file that changes to comments will be lost.  Maybe we can provide a way to add comments that won't get lost...

So I gave the toolbar top- and bottom-margins to become the height we need for the Australis theme. On Win7 and OSX this is easy with only one button height.

As far as I recall, the unified inbox was working fine when I installed thunderbird on this computer.

Steps to reproduce:  - create a GMail-IMAP account  - go into Copies & Folders of GMail account, \"Archive Options\" is hidden  - select \"Archives folder in Local Folders\" as target location  - \"Archive Options\" remains hidden though Local Folders supports subfolders  Thus, the \"hidden\" status is determined from the source server rather than the target server (using nsIImapIncomingServer.isGMailServer in bug 640342). The following situation may currently occur:   - create a second (here: POP) account  - in Copies & Folders, select the GMail account as target for archiving  - close and reopen Account Settings from the context menu of the POP account  - in Copies & Folders, \"Account Options\" is enabled though not supported  As this example shows, it would make more sense to enable or disable the \"Archive Options\" dialog dynamically based on the selected target account.",

Since access to the bugs should remain restricted, releasing the bugs back into the wild and deleting the group is not an option.  One solution is to add a column to the \"groups\" table that records whether or not a group is active.  An active group can be used in the same way groups are used in Bugzilla today.  An inactive group, on the other hand, has certain restrictions on how it can be used that are intended to discourage further use of the group.  In particular, it is not possible to add bugs to an inactive group.  There may also be other restrictions on that group.  I have created a patch that adds UI to the \"Edit Groups\" screen for de\/activating groups and hides the UI in the \"Edit Bug\" screen for adding a bug to an inactive group.

No message in the Rrror console. From looking at the code the button is wrapped inside #ifdef HAVE_SHELL_SERVICE but that seems to be set for linux-gtk2 globally. I have it set but getting the shell-service throws and exception. The code hides the exception and exits cleanly. I have gconf installed but maybe it does not work.  I think the buttons should not be exposed if we can know if it will work, via checking the shell-service. This patch hides the button and the checkbox, because also the \"search intergration\" checkbox in the same groupbox is hidden on unsupported systems. Or is it better to just disable it?  My take would be it's better to disable. Otherwise someone knowing where it is would be looking all over the place in vain.

We've done the good work for Bugzilla readability by mandating a consistent brace style. I think we should build on this by saying how we name things.  The following suggestions are based on what is current practice in the majority of our code:  - db field names should be lower-case and with words concatenated together, e.g. linkinfooter. - In general, if a variable represents a DB field, it should have the same name (or the plural form, if it's several of them.) The same applies to form fields. This has great advantages for code reuse and generalisation. - This rule may be broken on rare occasions for template variables, where dejargonification and understandability are paramount.  - variables, including template variables, should be all lower-case, and underscore_separated if separators are required. e.g. var show_bug; - CGI parameters should also be all lower-case, but word are simply concatenated together, e.g. &rescanall=1. - Functions should use StudlyCaps, with a leading capital. e.g. SendSQL(). (There is a dichotomy here; another valid choice would be as variables - lower-case and underscore_separated. But I suggest there's value in having them different from variables.). - Filehandles should be ALLCAPS.  There are already rules for template naming. New CGI names should also follow this rule - lower-case, and hyphen separated.  Existing code shouldn't be changed to conform to this standard unless it's being spanked already.",

The options disappear off the params page. - Every product has a place where you can specify the product's default groupset, required groupset and entry groupset. - Bugs automatically get the default groupset ORed with the required groupset when reported. - You cannot remove a restriction from a bug if its in the bug's product's required groupset. - You cannot enter a bug into a product unless the user is in the product's entry groupset. - A product will appear on the query, reports screen if the user is in the product's required groupset or entry groupset (because of reporter_accessible). - A product will appear on the entry screen if the user is in the product's entry groupset. - Because you specify gro",

(And in so doing stop using the buglist cookie, and so maybe allowing multiple buglists to work?)  2) In showbug.cgi, check when generating the buglist navigation bar and the Site Navigation Bar links if the bug being shown is actually part of the list, and don't show or enable the links if it isn't.",

        "FullDescription":"[RFE] JavaScript-enhanced keyword editing,JavaScript-enhanced keyword editingIt should be possible to use JavaScript to significantly improve the editing of the keywords field (while maintaining backwards compatibility for users without JavaScript).  Among other solutions to this problem, it is possible to use JavaScript to create two drop-down menus next to the keywords field.  The first menu contains a list of keywords currently in the field, while the second menu contains a list of all possible keywords.  When the user selects a keyword from the first (\"remove\") menu, that keyword is removed from the field.  When the user selects a keyword from the second (\"add\") menu, that keyword is added to the field.  When the user edits the keyword field manually, those edits are reflected in the \"remove\" menu, so that menu and the field are always in sync.  Future enhancements to this feature could include:  1. Displaying tool-tip descriptions of keywords as the user mouses over them in the menus or the field; 2. Preventing a user from manually typing in an invalid keyword or from entering a keyword twice (either manually or via the \"add\" menu); and  3. Reducing UI clutter by only having an \"add\" menu (since removing a keyword is arguably easy to accomplish manually, at least for those bugs whose list of keywords is not longer than the length of the field).

Actual results:  Only returned the string \"Thunderbird\".   Expected results:  According to the IRC's RFC (http:\/\/www.irchelp.org\/irchelp\/rfc\/) the client should return the client name and the version.  Sometimes bugs appear in the clients and Network Administrators must get rid of that buggy clients in order to ensure security of the Network users. One of the best \"weapons\" to detect the buggy versions is CTCP VERSION. If Thunderbird returns only the name of the client a bug on the client can result into a ban to all versions of the client.  I think that should be convenient to add the version number.

However, it still did not allow you to *create* a database  on such a system for the initial setup.  That bug was marked fixed, and a comment  said a new bug report should be opened for the problem with creating a database.   I haven't seen one yet, so this is it.  I have a new patch I'll be posting shortly that fixes this. :)  The trick was just to remove the database name from the connect string.  It was  trying to log into the database server and select that database in one fell  swoop, but that was a bad thing because we didn't know the database exists yet at  that point.  Now it logs into the server but doesn't select a database (which is  good because we're logging in at this point in order to see what databases are  there - we don't even know what's there yet).

Here's a preliminary patch that doesn't do much, except for getting the right files into the tree, writing the right manifests, Makefiles, and that sort of stuff. Also, getting rid of the overlays, and doing the right tweaks instead of monkey-patching all sorts of stuff.  Per the phone discussion with JB, here's a list of things that we should watch for. 1. Interaction with opensearch (what happens if the user has made a search engine his favorite choice through opensearch, and he then gets an account through one of our add-supported partners?). 2. Make sure the list of providers is stored remotely so that we can add new partners without having to deploy a new version of Thunderbird (Blake, I believe this is in place already, can you confirm this?). 3. Make sure the API for creating an account (i.e. the remote API) is well-defined. Apparently, this is not the case for Yahoo. 4. Another item related to configuring specific email accounts which I wrote down, but I'm not sure what this is supposed to refer to. Jb, thoughts?  I'll be mainly posting updates for the patch, and pinging Blake and maybe Andreas for design decisions, appearance stuff, etc.  Blake, here's some questions for you. - why did you rewrite the new ComposeMessage function? there doesn't seem to be anything specific in it, - I'm not sure I understand what you wanted to overlay with mailWizardOverlay.xul, - hopefully I didn't miss any place where one can create a new account.

Where can I get commercial support for Bugzilla?   should make reference to http:\/\/www.buzilla.org\/consulting.html  A.1.4 Who uses Bugzilla?   remove AtHome... they don't exist anymore, I think :)  A.1.5 Who maintains Bugzilla?   my address is now justdave@netscape.com :)  A.1.8 Why MySQL?   support for both Postgres and Sybase is planned for 2.18.  A.2.3 multiple products   the 55 group limit is gone.  It's now only limited to the number of unique keys available in the database (smallint, or about 32 thousand)  A.2.5 attachment types   Bugzilla will now autodetect the attachment mime-type based on what your web browser thinks the file is when you upload it.  A.2.7 reporting   The reporting system just got a complete overhaul.  I'm not sure what to change here, but I know it can do a lot more than it used to.  A.2.11 import\/export   buglist.cgi now allows output in both RDF and CSV formats (CSV can be imported into Excel).  There is a link at the bottom of the page for redisplaying the page in CSV format.  For RDF you need to add &ctype=rdf on the end of the URL (RDF is intended to only be machine readable, so it's assuming a program would be accessing that URL)   The report system now allows CSV output of several of the reports, as well.  A.2.12 translated\/localized versions   The answer to this is now Yes.  An up-to-date list of the known translations can always be found at http:\/\/www.bugzilla.org\/download.html in the \"Localized templates\" section.  A.2.13 Can the user create and save reports...   Yes. No.  Yes (sort of - CSV format can be read by Excel)  A.4.2 Need bugzilla to only send mail to me   The name of the param is \"newchangedmail\"  A.5.1 Bugzilla with Oracle?   RedHat Bugzilla has been updated to 2.17.1 and supports Postgres, not Oracle. RedHat no longer supports the Oracle version.  Their Postgres code will be getting merged with mozilla.org Bugzilla (so it will support both MySQL and Postgres) within the next month.  The work we are doing towards getting Bugzilla to work with Postgres and Sybase should make it much easier for someone else to port it to Oracle later if they wanted to.  A.5.3 Modifying the database   the \"mysql\" command-line shell is a bit easier to use than running everything through mysqladmin.  Might not hurt to mention that instead.  There are various GUI MySQL admin programs floating around now, too.  You can find several of them for Windows and Mac by searching for \"mysql\" on versiontracker.com  A.5.4 Password error in mysql 3.23.(29\/30)   This entry is obsolete.  Bugzilla a) now requires a newer version of MySQL than that, and b) no longer uses MySQL's crypt() function anyway (uses Perl's instead)  A.5.5 Can't connect to MySQL   You should add to this that if this solves their problem then they need to redo their permissions for the user Bugzilla is connecting as within MySQL.  A.7.5 attachment names are .cgi   In 2.17.1 you can now edit the filena",

The problem is, the properties of a msgHeaderSink are never reset, so the imip bar keeps showing.  Possible solutions (IIRC from the discussion on IRC with standard8): - not fix this, and assume it is up to lightning to reset the property if the message has no imip bar, - not fix this, and assume it is up to the thunderbird conversations plugin to reset the property after it's used it (assuming no one else on earth needs reading that property), - have someone set msgWindow.msgHeaderSink.properties to null.

Only *for writing messages*, Ctrl++\/- will change *size* of text, and Ctrl+0 does nothing. ==Message functions== section is only about reading messages, because we have a separate section for ==Writing messages== (and, OT, ==Message functions== really is not a very telling headline, and we need more sections here).  So in ==Message functions== section we should have:  Zoom In \tCtrl + + Zoom Out\tCtrl + - Reset Zoom\tCtrl + 0  And another documentation problem about the same shortcut further down the list (1):  ==Writing Messages== Restore Text Size: Ctrl+0  For composition only (!), this doesn't work for Windows (can't test elsewhere). Note that in composition, ctrl++ and ctrl+- make the actual *font size* of selected text bigger\/smaller, so Ctrl+0 should really restore the default text size (and not the zoom as we do for reading). On windows, Ctrl+0 doesn't do anything in composition. Does it work on other OS? Is it a regression?  Maybe somebody can explain the expected and current behaviour for all OS, so that we can fix the documentation, or create bugs as necessary.",

Mozilla seems to ignore the rows attribute, but I need to check if that is guarenteed. That page only wokrs in mozilla ATM, so I'm not worried about other browsers.  The mimetype warnings are all on the fact that we use text\/javascript instead of application\/x-javascript. Was this a deliberate decision made for old IE versions, or something? If not, I'll fix those, too.  This is for 2.18, not 2.16, although the account\/email\/confirm.html.tmpl part (<input type=\"input\">) may need to go into 2.16, since I can imagine browsers having issues with that.  Most of the fixes are obvious (& -> amp;, adding action attribute to <form>s, and alt to <img> and so on). Those that aren't include:  global\/useful-links.html.tmpl: gmuck warns about inconcistant quote style, so I changed these to use \" instead of ' (they were \" because of how we were quoting for TT)  search\/form.html.tmpl: gmuck picked up on:  [%# Note: the <form> tag is unclosed at the end of this template %]  as not having an action attribute.

Ideally, the same Bugzapp client would be able to be used with multiple Bugzilla  installations -- and a change in a Bugzilla database should not mean that the  client needs to be updated. This means that Bugzilla must become more modular and  transparent about what fields it uses, and what values it allows for each field.  If anyone is interested in working on such an app, I can rustle up some UI specs  for it.",

Following changes were made in bug 642163:  - the formatting bar has moved about 100px to the right, leading empty space;  - the end of the attachment pane is aligned with the end of the format bar.  Consequently,  - the minimum window size to show all UI items has increased by 100px;  - the attachment pane is cropped once the format bar gets truncated.  The latter effect is a regression from previous behavior where only the format bar was cropped but the attachment pane was allowed to slide into the address area without being truncated.  If possible, it would be good to uncouple the attachment pane from the format bar alignment, given that it becomes inaccessible when the window is small (which is typically the case for visually impaired users or those who don't want to use up the full screen; also, netbooks may be affected, where I don't know the size specifications).

That code is old and messy but was mostly working. However, the JS-IRC code can sometimes take more than half a second between a click on disconnect and when the account is actually disconnected, and that situation exposes a race in the existing code, that results in the \"connect\" button staying disabled.

The logic to display this page never triggers. In msgMail3PaneWindow.js\/OnLoadMessenger() we call LoadPostAccountWizard() which sets a timer on the \"window\" object to call loadStartFolder(). Then we call specialTabs.openSpecialTabsOnStartup(), which calls getApplicationUpgradeVersions() to check the old value of the \"mailnews.start_page_override.mstone\" pref **and set it to the current TB version**.  Then, later, the timer calls loadStartFolder() and a very twisty call chain gets to mailWindow.js\/loadStartPage(), which checks the \"...mstone\" pref, sees it is already set, and always chooses to display the Start page instead of the Firstrun page.  Short term fix, as advised by Standard8, is to rip out the \"first run\" logic and page.  If we decide later that we really want a different UX on first run, I recommend that we pull out the \"what is the old and new TB version, is this an upgrade or a first run\" logic into a separate thing (object, group of methods on some existing object, whatever) that caches the test result, and call it from all the places that care; that way we won't be sensitive to subtle execution order changes.",

If I do a query, then hit the \"Long Format\" Button after my query results appear, an error occurs. The error message says \"You'd have more luck if you gave me some bug numbers\"  I've looked around the code (I'm not a Perl Programmer! I'm a Java Guy) and I can't find where $buglist is getting assigned values for this perticular situation. I've notice that the cookie \"BUGLIST\" is populated . So my quick solution was to append $::COOKIE{\"BUGLIST\"} to the $buglist array at line 63 in long_list.cgi  This works, but I'm sure if this a valid or if it breaks anything.  --Tony \"  Thats not valid - we need to push $vars->{buglist} to the template so that its in the form.

If it's a single-select set of options, all is well.   If it's a  multi select, the default value is submitted as \"val1|val2|val3...\" and used as  a regular expression.  This produces incorrect results.  First of all, the \"^\" and \"$\" would have to  be used to match the entire expression.  Here is a snippet that proves it: @items = ('Foo', 'Foo Two', 'Bar', 'Bar Two', 'Baz', 'Baz Two'); $default = 'Foo|Bar';  If the $default is matched to @items as a regular expression, 4 of them match successfully even though only two options should be matched.  This same argument is true if the default values can contain any characters  that would be interpreted as meta-characters in regular expressions.  In short, it's not valid to consider pipe-delimited values to be valid \"or'd\"  regular expressions.   Rather, the code should split on '|' and compare the  values with the 'eq' operator.

Steps to Reproduce: Go to the Query page, enter an invalid user\/email  (like \"hellothere\") for the \"Email\" text box and then choose the matching pull- dowb option as \"exact\".  Actual Result: Should maybe come back with a clean error saying no such user.  Expected Result: Get the Internal server error. I can send the apache logs also  if needed.  Additional Information: I can look into this and see if I can get a patch out.  What's happening:   Bugzilla does a check to see if it can output the \"Bugzilla is pondering your   Query\" message (which only works w\/Mozilla and Netscape).  If it can, it does   If it can't, it spits out an incomplete header (so it can push more info later   if it needs to).  Somewhere after doing that, it checks to see if the \"exact\"   e-mail address matches one in the database, if it doen't the scripts errors   out and exists (telling the user that the \"exact\" e-mail address isn't in the   database).  The problem is that the error routine expects that the header has   already been completely outputted (the blank line has already happened).  How this patch fix it:   Before spitting out the error (and only if the error is gonna be spit out) it   sends a blank line.  This will complete the header and makes everyone happy.   This blank line won't have any adverse effects elsewhere because it'll only   show up in the HTML source, not on the page itself.  While this isn't a security issue, per se, 500 errors are something to avoid and the fix is simple, so I'm marking it 2.14.",

It would make sence if all tables that are referenced from other tables should be done so through use of a key. In the example outlined above of the components table being referenced from the bugs table, the components table should be augmented to have a primary key added to it with the bugs table having the component column replaced by a component_id column. This would mean that when the componets.value field was updated for whatever reason, no other field in the database need to change to keep the database current.

The well-developed bug infrastructure will be used to support requests.  Although requests are entered and resolved in a streamlined way, internally a request will really be a bug filed on a specific product and component that has been designated to accept these requests.  This means that all the standard facilities for dealing with bugs (mail, comments, re-assignment, querying, etc.) will be available for requests.  The fundamental difference is that requests will be \"filed\" via a special form and \"resolved\" via updates to other bugs.

I have never seen this \"gaps\" issues when sorting by ID.  Is it still happening  to you?  Can you give me a query where you see this so I can investigate?",

Now at first glance this might not matter, as you can use product determination in comment.txt.tmpl to distinguish comment templates.  However, I can imagine people wanting to redistribute there changed templates, and this essentially prohibits this action.  Because they are all in one file, it is possible to slot a new enter_bug template into default but not a new post_bug template, and therefore editing will always be required.  I would much prefer if you could slot in templates.  So basically each enter_bug template would pass a format name through to post_bug.cgi and post_bug.cgi would call the appropriate comment-format.txt.tmpl.

        "FullDescription":"midair when changing assignee gives errorThe problem with the code is that the trim() function in globals.pl uses the global variable $_ to store the value being trimmed.  Normally this won't cause problems, but in this situation the Perl interpreter is already using $_ as the value of $::FORM{'knob'} in the switch that starts on line 672 of process_bug.cgi.  I'm not sure exactly why this causes problems, but I suspect that Perl copies the value of $::FORM{'knob'} into $_ by reference rather than by value, so the value of $::FORM{'knob'} gets changed to the trimmed value of $::FORM{'assigned_to'} when the latter variable gets trimmed on line 708.  Using $_ as a temporary variable in trim() seems like a dangerous thing to do in general, so the patch changes trim() to use a local variable instead.",

At the time of event generation, there is no focused element in the window, but I don't think that should actually affect anything (and the window proper will just catch it; this needs more investigation\/remembering).  A possibility for the greater problem is that at the time we generate the failure notification, the Thunderbird window is not the active window, suggesting we may just be refusing to generate the event because the window is not focused.   This is one of those analyses where it would be nice to be able to easily see what the logging shows for a healthy run of the test.  Unfortunately, it's prohibitively expensive to log that data for successful tests for every run.  One easier way to address this without getting crazy would be to let us annotate specific runs as deserving of having their output logged every time.  We would do this by either leveraging the try server or doing a short-lived test-only type patch.  Another way would be to have runs where we do dump everything, but have that be a special buildbot job that only runs once a week or something.  The arbpl server would need to special-case these runs, but could then offer a \"compare with baseline\" option.",

This causes an authentication failure in the cookie based user authentication, forcing the user to have to log on again (right after they've changed their passwords).    When the user logs on, a new cookie (which reflects the changed password) is set, and the cookie-based authentication mechanism works again.  This is not a serious bug.  It is just a bit annoying for users to have to retype usernames and passwords immediately after they've just typed them in (in the change password process).  Steps to reproduce:  - log in  - go to the edit prefs page (userprefs.cgi)  - on the account settings bank, change your password (fill in old password, new password, re-enter new password and click on submit)  - Bugzilla comes back with a message to the effect that the changes have been saved  - click on any of the links where authentication is required (e.g. enter_bug.cgi, any of the other banks on user preferences - e.g. email settings)  - Bugzilla requests reauthentication of the user   (The SQL statement in the subroutine quietly_check_login in CGI.pl will set $ok to 0 if profiles.cryptpassword != logincookies.cryptpassword)   Suggested fix: Add a few lines to the subroutine SaveAccount to sync the cryptpassword fields in the tables profiles and logincookies when user passwords are changed.",

This is not acceptable.  Increasingly problems are being pinned on this issue.  Apparently this only happens when you do a print - hopefully that's true.  In this case templatisation would help greatly.  However, we'd lose incremental output for process_bug.cgi, which would be useful, so I would prefer to be able to use template fragments there and use another technique where necessary.  Gerv fingered this for part of bug #99788, but I'm not sure that's correct because it supposedly requires prints in between.  Dave has seen before that when you quit a bulk change it stops part way through.  That was good in the particular circumstance, but I'd say it isn't in general.  I have _confirmed_ that this is at least one (and maybe the only) circumstance where emails fail to get sent out.  This can happen when you change dependencies and the emails for the other side doesn't get sent out.  So what to do?  For some things this behaviour is desirable (sanity check, where incremental is good as well), and with some things templates are enough (where incremental output is not needed), but it would be nice to have a middle ground where this doesn't occur and we can have incremental output (for process_bug.cgi).",

        "FullDescription":"System integration - Default mail client setting not integrated wellThis bug was reported in Launchpad: https:\/\/launchpad.net\/bugs\/630281  Currently, when you set Thunderbird to be the default mail client from the Thunderbird UI on GNOME, it sets \"\/desktop\/gnome\/url-handlers\/mailto\/command\" to something like $XCurProcD\/thunderbird (on Ubuntu, this path is currently \/usr\/lib\/thunderbird-3.1.3\/thunderbird).  This has a couple of problems:  1) It breaks upgrades if the path has the version number in it (which is the Ubuntu bug). Ok, I suppose that could also be argued as a distro-problem too.  2) It causes the default mail client in gnome-default-application-properties to be displayed as \"Custom\" rather than \"Thunderbird\". This is because the settings dialog expects the setting to just be an executable in the users path. I suppose that could be changed too, but that isn't how other applications work.  3) Setting the default mail client in gnome-default-application-properties to Thunderbird doesn't stop Thunderbird asking to be the default mail client.  The way I think that this should work is:  1) If thunderbird is in the users path and it is a symbolic link to something in $XCurProcD, set the key to \"thunderbird %s\", else... 2) Fall back to \"$XCurProcD\/thunderbird %s\".  So, most users with a single install of Thunderbird will have the key set to \"thunderbird %s\". It also allows for users to download, extract and run other instances of Thunderbird if they want to, and still be able to set them as the default mail client too, without installing them properly (it would just use the full path for those in that case).

At least the german translation does not clearly describe the fact, that the threshold is meant as sum over all folders, because in german the plural form for 'folder' is the same than the singular form.    Actual results:  The german translation in options of: \"Compact folder, if that saves more space than x MB\" IMO is ambiguous. It's not clear, if ... that is meant as sum over all folders rather than space per folder. ... only that big folders are compacted at all.

        "FullDescription":"Allow attachment pane of a message to open non-collapsed by defaultThe redesign of the attachment pane in bug 282068 now shows it collapsed with a nice indication about the number of attachments and their size. This is an improvement for users frequently receiving many attachments, or with mostly inlined-displayed content (images or text) for which the attachment list and icons would be redundant.  However, another class of users will typically receive a small amount of attachments, and they may not be displayable inline (e.g., PDF or Word files). Consequently, these users now need a click more, (1) open the attachment pane, (2) double-click on the attachment to open it. Even more, if just a single attachment is received, its name is presented next to the button, but that label isn't clickable and thus can't be used to open the attachment.  A couple of possible solutions to this issue:  (a) Add an explicit preference setting whether top open collapsed=true\/false; (b) remember the last setting (opened or closed) and use it for the next opened     message (may be more intuitive than a hidden pref); (c) have some \"more\"-style mechanism, thus showing a single row of attachments     and allow it to expand with the button if more attachments are present     (this would be my personal favorite, easily allowing the first attachments     to be accessed while not filling up considerable space if more than one     row is needed).",

Talking to Ubuntu folks at UDS-N, we discussed what changes need to happen in Thunderbird to fit in to the new shell.  This is a meta bug.  We'll file dependent bugs for each bit.  For context though, the broad strokes are:   - Unity has a global menu rather than in-window menu (similar to what OS X does).  Thunderbird should use that menu when run under Unity.  Note that the shell can be chosen at runtime, so compile time decisions aren't appropriater here (unlike the mac).   - Unity includes a task list for each app that registers in the dock.  Thunderbird should register tasks (and there are different tasks possible when the app is running and not).  This is likely related from the TB point of view to Windows 7 jump lists.   - Unity includes a single messaging menu in the top right (in LTR locales), which all messaging apps should use to communicate things like number of new messages, etc.  Thunderbird should integrate there as well.  Note that AFAICT the way to do this is to talk via DBUS, which will likely require changes in mozilla-central, such as integration in the gtk event loop, etc.  (We should find whatever bug currently tracks that work).

Actual results:  After double-clicking, the feed item will open in either a new tab, a new message window or an existing message window, per \"Tools > Options > Reading & Display > Open messages in:\"  To jump to the webpage associated with the feed item, the user then clicks the \"Website\" link in the header section of the tab\/window where the feed item opened.  At that point, the content associated with the feed item will be open in both a Thunderbird tab\/window and also a browser tab\/window. (Which ultimately means two tabs\/windows to close, and the clutter is multiplied by however many feed items the user is in the habit of opening and then viewing in a browser rather than Thunderbird.)   Expected results:  When double-clicking a feed item, would like the option to open its \"Website\" header field directly in my default browser, without first spawning a new Thunderbird tab\/window.  Akin to having an option for default functionality something like one or more of the following...     \"View > Feed Message Body As... > In Browser\"     secondary mouse click feed item > context menu: \"Open Message in Browser\"     \"Tools > Options > Reading & Display > Open feed message in: > Browser\"  Of course, the content of the feed item itself and the content of the linked \"Website\" header field are technically two distinct things. But I'm rarely interested in the feed item's own content, separate from the linked \"Website\" field.

        "FullDescription":"Attached .rtf files are opened as though they were flat text (TXT) files and show all the control charactersUser-Agent:       Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko\/20100722 Firefox\/3.6.8 Build Identifier: v3.1.2  Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko\/20100802 Thunderbird\/3.1.2  When I double click on a .rtf (Rich Text Format) file attached to an email I have received, the default application (I have associated OpenOffice Writer which can read .rtf files) opens the file as a flat text (ie a TXT) file and displays all the control characters.  It does not respect the .rtf qualifier.  If the file is called fred.rtf, the OO Writer bar shows \"fred.rtf-4.txt (Read only) - OpenOffice.org Writer\".  The 4 increments by 1 every time I retry.  This means that Thunderbird appears to have appended a TXT qualifier after the RTF qualifier.  OO Writer is therefore being told that this is a TXT file, not an RTF file.  No doubt this is why I see all the control characters.  If I detach fred.rft and save it to my hard disk, OpenOffice opens the file properly and I see the correct contents.  This is as expected - OpenOffice can read and write .rtf files.  The file is obviously OK.  I am running Windows 7 so I looked in the temporary folder C:\\Users\\my_name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp where Thunderbird creates the temporary, read only file it views. When I double clicked on the .rtf file attached to the email, a file called fred.rtf.txt appeared in the Temp folder, and OpenOffice opened this file.   If I forward the received email with the attached fred.rtf file, then while I am editing the email I am forwarding, I can open the attached fred.rtf file with Writer, and it opens OK.  When I check in the Temp folder, the file Thunderbird has created is called nsmail-8.tmp - ie it is NOT a TXT, nor an RTF file. OO obviously pens this TMP file OK.  The email header is: Content-Type: application\/octet-stream; name=\"fred.rtf\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"fred.rtf\"  As a test, I renamed the file in \\Temp from fred.rtf.txt to fred.rtf - that is I just removed the extra .txt extension added by Thunderbird.  When I double clicked on the renamed file in the Temp folder, it opened OK in OO.   Some recipients of my emails with attached RTF files have commented that they cannot open the RTF files.   There appear to be a number of similar bugs reported - namely https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=213393, https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=205871 and https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=580585  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Create an RTF file called fred.rtf which contains the single text word zebra.  2.  Edit and email and attach the file fred.rtf to the email.  3.  While I am editing the email, if I click on fred.rtf, it opens OK and I see the word zebra.  4  Send myself the email.    5  Receive the email and click on the fred.rtf attachment in order to open it.  It opens with my default application OpenOffice Writer, but all the control characters are shown, namely {\\rtf1\\ansi\\deff0\\adeflang1025 {\\fonttbl{\\f0\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f1\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f2\\fswiss\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Arial;}{\\f3\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f4\\froman\\fprq0\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f5\\fnil\\fprq0\\fcharset0 times new roman{\\*\\falt new york};}{\\f6\\fmodern\\fprq1\\fcharset128 MS Mincho{\\*\\falt \\'82\\'6c\\'82\\'72 \\'96\\'be\\'92\\'a9};}{\\f7\\fnil\\fprq0\\fcharset0 Mangal;}} ... etc  3  Detach fred.rtf from the email and store it on my hard disk.  Open it with OO - it opens OK and I see the word zebra.   Expected Results:   When I open an RTF file I expect to see only the formatted text - I do not expect to see all the control characters.  A workaround is to detach the rtf file from the email before opening.  Why does the temporary file in C:\\ ...\\Temp have TXT added as its qualifier after RTF??

        "FullDescription":"process_bug.cgi calls CheckCanChangeField() with --do_not_change-- valuesThis is not a problem with Mozilla's Bugzilla per se, but it is for those of us who are customizing it (and maybe someday you folks would be in this situation).  I have added logic to CheckCanChangeField to restrict changing the contents of certain fields (ones that I have added) to members of groups I have defined. This worked great until someone tried to use the extended \"Change Multiple bugs at once\" capability and they were caught by the membership checks even though they weren't changing those fields.  This is because the logic for handling multiple bugs calls CheckCanChangeField (line 842 in process_bug.cgi) with the form value even though the form value is --do_not_change--. Of course, this differs from what is in the database, so it falls through to my checks for membership and the change is refused.  I think CheckCanChangeField() (or the call to it) should check for --do_not_change-- in the field value. I suspect the reason no one else has run into this is because almost all the fields currently being tested in CheckCanChangeField happen to not be ones which are set to --do_not_change-- on the multiple bug form. (The one exception is QA contact, which has its own special check).  So, thought I would share my experience in hopes it would save someone else somewhere along the way.

We need to automatically generate the actions from here, including:  Whether the bug gets confirmed by the transition, whether the resolution needs to be cleared or asked, etc.  We need to handle automatic transitions somehow.  These include popular vote (either put one status on the status table for each unconfirmed open status or have a special transition).  Also, automatic sleep\/wakeups like ASLEEP (bug #8527) and REMIND (bug #65402) could hopefully be in this scheme.  We need to know when it can be put to sleep manually, when it should occur automatically, when it should wake up automatically and when it should be able to be woken up manually.  We could do various sanity checks on transitions:  - Prevent automatic transitions from going to open to non-open and vice versa, and similar sanity checks. - Prevent going to unconfirmed except from other unconfirmed.",

I didn't even need to reselect the msg or anything. Well, the result of FormatDisplayName function is not null but \"null\" (a string) now. And that is no longer falsy as we expect in later code.

        "FullDescription":"(unintentionally) double clicking on attachment runs two concurrent \"save\" task  and corrupts the saved file.When I try to save an attachment to a message in thunderbird, either by mistake or mishandling of a pointing device, I essentially double clicks on the attachment where, it seems, a single mouse click is enough.  Problem is that this two clicks caused by \"double-click\" seems to run TWO (2) \"save\" threads concurrently (there does not seem to be a lock to serialize this), and as a result, while the saving of the first may start or even about to finish, the second thread may interfere, ESPECIALLY when a group of attachments are to be saved, and I don't realize that the second dialog I am about to click is the FIRST window of the SECOND thread to save an already saved (or its saving is in operation) attachment.  If I click on this second dialog, then I mess up the saving process. The typical symptom is that   - TB says something about it is not able to read the original source of the    copy (I am using Japanese locale and not sure what the corresponding English message is), but the meaning of the message is very obscure: why on earth TB    can not read the ATTACHMENT already in its folder(?!).   - The two threads somehow does not cause the first obnoxious mysterious message     to appear, but they either    - leaves corrupted attachment file, or    - more likely it leaves ATTACHMENT-SAVED-FILENAME.part temporary file behind      (note the \".part\" suffix) and      often I find 0-sized ATTACHMENT-SAVED-FILENAME.  It has shown up a few version before and not sure when exactly. But maybe within a last year(?)  Double-clicking is often done by mistake and this behavior of thunderbird saving feature is very obnoxious.  There ought to be a serialization mechanism so that another thread does not stomp on the already running saving operation of an attachment.",

I installed a filter to copy RSS items to the inbox root folder whose subject contains at least one of a number of keywords.   Actual results:  In the inbox list view all filtered RSS messages expectedly appear besides my IMAP mails. But sometimes a subjects is displayed wrong.   In the current case a series of three items are listed in my inbox that were copied from RSS by my filter. The subject of the first item displayed in the list is wrong: the third's suject is diplayed instead of it's own. When I select any of the three items in the list view they are displayed correct in the preview window but the list view stays wrong.  I do not remember surely but I believe that the error does not appear when only a single RSS item is copied during a filter call. I do remember exactly whether headers of RSS and mails are interchanged between themselves. I believe the error only appears when RSS items exist: mail only lists without aggregeted RSS items seem not to be concerned.  The error is not new in TB12, I remember to have seen it before for at least about two years (also in my former Oses WinXP64 and 32)  When I restart TB (restart included an update to TB 14) the error persists. Compacting folders does not help, too. Copying the series of RSS items (from the screenshot) to an IMAP subfolder the wrong subjects are displayed there, too.

Steps to reproduce:  1)  With a fresh profile, install Test Pilot for Thunderbird 1.3.4 from AMO. 2)  Shut Thunderbird down.  Open up the profile's localstore.rdf file, and find the folderPaneBox description entry. 3)  For the folderPaneBox description entry, add an attribute collapsed=\"true\".  Your folderPaneBox description entry should now look something like this:  <RDF:Description RDF:about=\"chrome:\/\/messenger\/content\/messenger.xul#folderPaneBox\"                    collapsed=\"true\"                    width=\"242\" \/>  Now start up Thunderbird with Tabs on Top, and switch to the 3pane.  What happens:  It's a race condition, so it doesn't always happen - but a number of times, the folderPane will be collapsed by default on startup.  What's expected:  The attribute should be ignored, like it has been for years and years.  Explanation:  So localstore.rdf can potential contain a lot of fragments of old UI customization parameters (like info on toolbars that no longer exist, etc).  Sometimes, the elements that those customization parameters apply to still do exist, but the attributes are supposed to be ignored - like in the case of folderPaneBox.  What's more; when going to View > Layout, and setting the Folder Pane attribute to visible, it doesn't work the first time, only the second.

Well, I happened to be staring at some code, and I think I found out how.  If a .cgi calls GetVersionTable() more than once and if it has been exactly one hour since the versioncache file was last created, then this problem can result.  The first time it gets called, it decides that the existing file is recent enough it loads the data from the versioncache file.  The second time, the clock has ticked over one second and so it now decides the versioncache file is out-of-date.  So, it goes to regenerate it.  Well, all the regeneration code assumes that the variables start out empty, so it is going to append new data to the end of the existing data in memory from the first time it loaded.  Oops.

        "FullDescription":"checksetup.pl dependency on CGI::CarpDave, I hope you don't mind me assigning this to you intially -- if you think it's in Tara's or Cyeh's department or something, take it away : )  We have an undocumented dependency on CGI::Carp in Checksetup.pl. I am documenting this for the next release of the Bugzilla Guide.  This bug, however, I'm filing for someone to fix checksetup.pl so that it checks for the presence of CGI::Carp before executing (rather than dumping with an Unhandled Exception).  Here's a copy of the email I sent to the newsgroup:  I'm going to file a bug on this in a few minutes...  I'm running through my install docs and noted this bug in checksetup.pl on a  vanilla install of Linux-Mandrake 8.0.  Unfortunately, I do not have \"CGI::Carp\" in the documentation as a  prerequisite; I believe the assumption was that it was always installed with  Perl -- but that ain't the case with Mandrake 8.0 and Perl 5.6.0.  Anybody  feel like hacking checksetup.pl to mark this as a dependency, while I get  this prerequisite listed in the documentation?  I've verified this fixes the problem: bash# perl -MCPAN -e 'install \"CGI::Carp\"'  However, this needs to be documented (my responsibility, I'm working on it)  and fixed in checksetup.pl so that it checks for the presence of this module  (not my job, but I'll do it if nobody else wants to).

There is a small problem about wich i always think, when i have to show bugzilla to other people:  If You now check query page you will see something like this: ----------------------------------------- Summarry (contains...^) [_________________] [Search]  then come all the fields (a lot of them, you will agree :)  and then:  (.) Run this query ( ) Load my remembered query:    ( ) Run my remembered query: ( ) Forget my remembered query:  ( ) Remember this as my default query ( ) Remember this query, and name it:       [x] and put it in my page footer  Sort results by: [          ^]  [Search] -----------------------------------------  On the top the search button is intuitive and does what it says, but i think that something has to be done with [Search] at bottom: the problem is, that in fact \"Search\" will be performed only, if you tick \"run this query\". In other cases it will load, forget, remember, run remembered, aso.  Also \"run this query\" is not quite \"search\" (because then the logic sentence is \"search run this query\" ) - it's more like \"do\" or \"ok\"  I suggest to rename this button to 'Ok' or 'Do it!' or 'I will feel buggy tomorrow' (um, ignore the last one). And also - to split the form submit logic into \"Search\" and \"Do the other things\" (now, if i check everything at bottom, press the search button on top, it will do the same what at bottom)  p.s. also - right now i checked bugzilla tip (http:\/\/landfill.tequilarista.org\/bugzilla-tip\/query.cgi) , and if it will look like what it looks now, then i suggest to remove(hide) the radio \"run this search\" and leave the text, because there is no sence for radio button with only one option (unless it's dynamic)",

If this happens accidentally, especially while the user is not paying much attention, the address books appear to gone because the splitter looks just like part of an unusually wide window border. It does not indicate function. And even worse: This UI setting is remembered, so closing an re-opening the window does not help.  It seems natural to review the \"view\" menu in this case, but it offers no command to restore the address books pane.  For a user who is not actively maintaining his\/her address books, the problem is aggravated by the fact that the first default address book \"personal addresses\" may be empty and all addresses are stored in \"collected addresses\". As the first address book is always selected when opening the address books window (regardless of the last selected book), it might appear to the user that all addresses are simply gone.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. open address book window 2. drag vertical splitter to the left beyond the point at which the address books pane instantly collapses Actual Results:   Address books appear to be gone and there is no menu command to make them reappear  Expected Results:   Address books pane should not collapse completely. Or if it has to: - This should happen smoothly, not with an instant snap of the splitter to the left. - The splitter, being at the far left, should have a strong visual cue that something is hidden and can be made to reappear by clicking\/dragging. - There should be a command in the view menu to toggle th address books pane visibility.  The described problem occurred to my girlfriend. After she complained to me that \"all my addresses are gone\", I investigated and it took me - as a software developer and long-time Thunderbird user - several minutes to spot the splitter in the far left (btw: the window was maximized, which makes it even harder to spot).

        "FullDescription":"handle CGI timeouts\/aborts by aborting database callsSome (many? all?) webservers abort CGI scripts if they output no text for long periods of time.  In the case of Apache, this seems to be 300 seconds (5 minutes).  For bugzilla.mozilla.org, this is probably a good value, because we don't want the shadow db tied up for much longer than that (syncs cannot happen while searches are going on).  It turns out that the current mechanism for aborting the scripts doesn't cause any in-progress SELECTs to be aborted, which means that truly bad searches can and do continue for very long periods of time (hours even -- thus causing the shadow_db to remain out of sync).  Bugzilla needs to have abort-handlers that kill any appropriate running SQL calls (not necessarily all SQL calls, however, as we can't afford to leave the db in an inconsistent state).  After much groveling through documentation (as well as the source code to Apache), I think I've figured out the strategy for this.  It appears as though when CGIs are timed out by Apache, they get sent a SIGTERM and then three seconds later a SIGKILL, so this is an opportunity to cleanup. Ideally, we'd use the DBI statement cancel function.  Unfortunately, DBI::mysql doesn't implement that, but presumably it could be added.  Alternately,  we could find the $dbh->{'thread_id'} and then use system() to fork off a mysqladmin to kill the thread in question or even perhaps exec() mysqladmin in our own process slot.  Note, however, that \"man DBI\" tells us that:         The first thing to say is that signal handling in Perl is        currently not safe. There is always a small risk of Perl        crashing and\/or core dumping when, or after, handling a        signal.  (The risk was reduced with 5.004_04 but is still        present.)  There is also experimental code included with 5.005 (Thread::Signal) which runs which runs signal handlers on a separate thread.  However, 5.005 doesn't appear to me to be built multithreaded by default, so this seems overly risky.  In any case, we'll need to encourage folks to upgrade to 5.004_04.  And crashing in a signal handler will usually be better than running forever and leaving the shadow database out of sync.  Probably the short-term fix is to just use a cronjob script that runs 'mysqladmin processlist' every so often and kill off any long-running threads. In fact, we're likely to want to do this anyway, given the signal-handler lossage.  It also wouldn't be difficult to patch MySQL to cause long_queries to be killed when they hit the time limit.  With both of these quick fixes, though, I'm a bit afraid of one really evil SELECT (which might take > 5 mins on its own) significantly slowing down other SELECTs (which might only take 3 mins on their own) and then having the entire batch of threads get killed).  Probably the answer to this (easy to implement in the cronjob) is to never kill more than 1 thread per x minute interval, for some value of x.",

We have a component for everyone of our clients (yes there are a ton of components). It is our largest product, so trying to search for customer issue bugs without limiting it to the particular customer we want is a major pain.  We could change the name to just 'customer-issue' I suppose, but we have the _ in front so that it always sorts to the top of all lists. (it's used the most so it should be at the top shouldn't it.) That also doesn't change the fact that this is a bug.",

(based on revision #5594),TB: Keyboard Shortcuts documentation: Major Revision #5614 (based on revision #5594): content and markup cleanupThis bug is intended for details and discussion of a major revision of the Keyboard Shortcuts documentation article which I am about to land (and I want to try linking here from that revision's comment, so I need this bug first). Please find the URL of that revision in the URL field or subsequent comments.  I created this major revision based on sreepriya's great foundational work in revision 5594 (2) which conflated the markup by 32% (from 14682 down to 9912 characters) in spite of adding content. That revision makes the markup just so much more readable and easier to maintain:  - correct markup for keyboard shortcuts: e.g. nifty {key Ctrl+Shift+Tab} instead of wrong and bulky {button Ctrl} + {button Shift} + {button Tab}  - correct markup for identical cross-OS shortcuts: e.g. slim {for win,linux}{key...}{\/for}{for mac}{key...}{\/for} instead of redundant and confusing {for win}{key...}{\/for}{for mac}{key...}{\/for}{for linux}{key...}{\/for}  I'll approve sreepriya's revision 5594 (2) to acknowledge and preserve this revolutionary improvement. It comes with a number of minor glitches which I will fix with my upcoming revision documented here.  In addition, I have once again fixed a whole lot of previously existing issues: - fix\/improve wrong\/misleading\/insufficient command captions - fix\/remove wrong\/outdated keyboard shortcuts (wip) - add product version selectors for some shortcuts that changed (what's the point of having the version selector if we don't maintain it?) - minor changes to the sequence of shortcuts in the list (wip) - add OS-sensitive markup in the introduction - cross the t's and dot the i's in the markup, removing extra spaces etc.  I might add the bugs which I have touched with this revision as dependants of this bug (unless specified otherwise in subsequent comments). In some cases, fixes and improvements might be preliminary or incomplete because I can't verify shortcuts on Linux and MAC. I have filed respective bugs which are awaiting verification.  The revision documented here is an incremental update but it's not the end of the road. A lot more needs to be done, pls refer to tbkbd-doc-tracker Bug 714031 and tbkbd-docnew-tracker Bug 714044 for details.  Any hints or comments regarding this revision are welcome here.",

With this revision, after many hours if not days of work, I'll land a wide range of major improvements:  - add about 30 shortcuts that were missing (bug 716254), especially for, but not limited to composition - major regrouping of shortcuts in \"message functions\" section - add separate section for \"Search and filter functions\" (they are too important to be lost in the crowd) - conflate \"Newsgroup messages\" section with only 3 newsgroup-specific commands into \"Message functions\" section (the old structure was logically misleading because all message functions also apply to newsgroup messages) - add subsection table headings to all sections, group logically related functions (for meaningful and human-friendly navigation instead of endless one-for-all lists lacking recognizable structure - after all, this is a HELP document!) - add linkified TOC to this article (to allow fast-track navigation) - add linkified TOC for list of shortcuts (main section headings) - add links for quick navigation within shortcuts list, including inter-section cross-references - improve some command captions - fix\/remove wrong\/outdated keyboard shortcuts (done)  I'll add the bugs which I have improved or fixed with this revision as dependants of this bug (unless specified otherwise in subsequent comments). In very few cases, fixes and improvements might be preliminary or incomplete because I cannot verify shortcuts on Linux and MAC. I have filed respective bugs which are awaiting verification.  This revision is a major milestone as it concludes a series of major revisions to reconvert \"Keyboards Shortcuts\" into a useful document that keeps the promise with complete, accurate, and accessible information. Still, it may not be the end of the road (and nobody\/nothing is perfect). For further refinements, pls refer to tbkbd-doc-tracker Bug 714031 and tbkbd-docnew-tracker Bug 714044. And please help to keep it up-to-date, by adding anything of relevance to tb-keyboard-tracker bug 713979 and tbkbd-doc-tracker Bug 714031.

Get Mozilla-Build to include it. It's pure python, so not a hassle at all to include. 2. Add it to the comm-central repo. It's MIT-licensed and build-only, so I don't really see an issue there. 3. Get people on Windows to easy_install it. easy_install pypng.  Mark, Gozer, opinions?

It was suggested that we do something with the chat button instead.  I'm closing bug 740358 as I checked-in the fix that's attached there, so I'm opening this new bug to further discuss and implement this proposed additional improvement.  See comment 1 to comment 9 in bug 740358 for more details.  This patch contains the required code changes to stop reopening the chat tab automatically, and to set an attribute on the chat toolbar button when there are unread messages directed to the user (either private messages, or messages containing the user's nick).  For the chat button, the current patch sets the \"checked\" attribute to \"true\" when there are unread messages, as it's the only thing that I found that causes a difference of appearance without any theming changes. The attribute name should probably be changed (\"highlight\"? \"unread\"?) once Andreas has some CSS changes to go with this patch. (It can trivially be edited in the _updateChatButtonState method. It would also be trivial to have the number of unread messages in the attribute; if there's a way to display that inside the button and it's wanted).",

It totally messes up the system; the output of the command is directed to stdout normally (as if no piping occurred), but even worse, no subsequent output is delivered to stdout! So in the example above, foo would not be printed, but the processmail output would. The exact characteristics of the problem may be slightly different, that was just my preliminary test.  The behavior is (to some extent) documented here:  http:\/\/aspn.activestate.com\/ASPN\/Reference\/Products\/ActivePerl\/lib\/Pod\/perlfork.html (see section Caveats and limitations)  Some workarounds are presented, but there are some difficult complications involved - see the bugs section on that page.

        "FullDescription":"checksetup.pl run through a dictionary and a timeless parsing,checksetup.pl : spelling, wording, and whitespace fixesAlmost everything is spelling, I'll attach the spelling tool I used since it will come in handy later.  It's not perfect, but basically you use it like this:  wordsplitter inputfile > outputfile spellcheck outputfile  in the spellchecker you stare at the misspelled word field and hover over the ignore button. you click ignore a *lot* of times until you've reached the end of the document. Every now and then your brain says \"hey that's not supposed to be there\", when you realize you reached one of those points you should stop clicking.  go back to the word, you'll see something that looks like this:  multiplicable (1454:1)  That tells you that on line 1454 of your input file the 1th thing that it found that resembled a word failed the dictionary lookup.  J:\\2002\\bugz\\mozilla\\webtools\\bugzilla>grep -n+ multiplicable *.pl File checksetup.pl: 1454        is_multiplicable    TINYINT       NOT NULL  DEFAULT 0 ,  Open the inputfile and goto the line and work on a correction. The error listed above is not corrected because it has structural meaning, so someone else will have to fix it.  Suggested sequence: read the file once, fix all the grammar and similar issues first. Then run the wordsplitter and then fix the spelling errors (this way you can catch your own too).",

Development\/Review Process --------------------------  All new development should adhere to the Hackers' Guide. How the reviewing process works. How do I become a reviewer? How to check in  Release Notes -------------  Update dependencies, important outstanding issues, introduction, deprecated features. Add new section for changes from last version.  Check through Bonsai and Bugzilla for interesting changes to add. Keep style of existing document, esp. with regard to bug numbers, sections and indentation. Remember to scan change sections from previous versions of the release notes.  They make need to be updated for users jumping over versions.  Documentation -------------  Compiling the documentation. Using macros.  Releasing ---------  Use the existing list on the release tracking bug. Mention creating release tracking and notes bug (if its not on the list just mentioned).
