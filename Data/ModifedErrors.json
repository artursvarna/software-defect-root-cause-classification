But I suggest a adding a \"Language-Pack\" product under \r\nbugzilla with the components being the different localizations.\r\n\r\nthe reason for this are (among other):\r\n\r\n1. average users can have dificulties finding the right place \r\n(browser-internalization) especially if they saw the error in e.g. mail-news\r\n\r\n2. The sheer number of possible bug, this will most likely overwhelm the owner \r\nof browser-internalization.\r\n\r\n3. some bug reports might be written in the actual locale, or might be \r\nmissing information about which locale has the problem,and this will make it \r\nharder to assign the rigth man,\r\n\r\nimage a bug like this:\r\n\r\n\"Jeg har lige downloadet den her MozScape ting, den er egentlig meget fed, og \r\noversættelsen er også god, Jeg synes dog 'navn på adressebog' skal laves om til \r\n'adressebogens navn' Det lyder bedre\"\r\n\r\nhow can easely assing this bug ?\r\n\r\n* and with the number of localizations (38 at the time of writing) i think it is \r\nworth the work\r\n\r\n4. having it split up, can automate many of the assignments, plus it seems \r\nlogical to the avarege user."

For people who live halfway around the globe or even just a few timezones \r\n   away, the \"View Bugs Already Reported Today\" link on Mozilla's Bugzilla\r\n   is nowhere near as useful for finding reports of regressions in the current\r\n   nightly as a canned query that would look for bugs reported today /and/\r\n   yesterday.\r\n4. Previously the \"Changed in the last __ days\" field could be used in \r\n   conjunction with any of the \"Where the field(s)\" items to search,\r\n   for instance, for bugs whose resolution has changed in the last week.\r\n\r\n... and an observation: \r\n\r\nThe \"Changed in the last __ days\"  field still works as expected when the\r\n\"Where the field(s)\" field is empty -- presumably it still does when that\r\nfield isn't empty, but the \"\" in the \"dates ___\" field equating to today\r\nis further limiting the search so you'd never know.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn't mind if this functionality was moved to the boolean\r\nchart part of the form, even though it would not be as clear ( [bug creation]\r\n[ <= ] [2] ), but specific date searching just can't do all the work that\r\nrelative date searching can do.\r\n\r\nIf \"\" in the \"dates ___\" field is equating to today, that is a bug -- empty\r\nfields should not limit a search at all."

You can accidently remove someone if you remove one \r\nletter from their email address while trying to edit the list.  What I propose is \r\nto place a listbox on the form with the current CC addresses in it.  Under the \r\nlistbox would be a checkbox for \"remove selected addresses\".  If you want to \r\nremove someone, you select their name in the list, and check the remove box.  \r\nThere would also be a text input under it for \"Add CC\" to allow you to add one or \r\nmore additional addresses.\r\n\r\nFor related bugs that aren't quite the same, see:\r\n- bug 7345 (blind CCs)\r\n- bug 28849 (don't allow non-editors to add/remove anyone other than themselves) \r\n- bug 34488 (button to add me to the CC list)\r\n\r\nI am attaching two files to this bug.  The first is a diff of bug_form.pl with \r\nthe code changes to place this list on the form.  The second is an HTML file with \r\nthe output of the above form.\r\n\r\nNOTE: DO NOT install this on a production Bugzilla (yet).  Although this \r\nbug_form.pl is fully functional, I have not modified process_bug.cgi to handle \r\nthe revised fields yet, and it'll break things without both files being updated.  \r\nI'm putting this here now so people can look at it.  Feel free to put it on a \r\ntest installation and look at bugs with it, but don't try changing them or you'll \r\nlikely delete people off the CC lists. :)\r\n\r\nRegarding process_bug.cgi, I would like help updating this to handle the new \r\nfields.  I do not quite understand what it's doing, and don't want to break it.  \r\nI could probably figure it out if I stared at it a while, but if whoever wrote \r\nthe RelationSet.pm thing would take a look at it, it would probably be much \r\neasier for them.  (copying those two on this bug for that reason)\r\n\r\nIn the new form, the listbox is named 'cc', the checkbox for remove is named \r\n'removecc', and the text input for adding CCs is named 'newcc'."

This causes\r\nan authentication failure in the cookie based user authentication, forcing the\r\nuser to have to log on again (right after they've changed their passwords).  \r\n\r\nWhen the user logs on, a new cookie (which reflects the changed password) is\r\nset, and the cookie-based authentication mechanism works again.\r\n\r\nThis is not a serious bug.  It is just a bit annoying for users to have to\r\nretype usernames and passwords immediately after they've just typed them in (in\r\nthe change password process).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n - log in\r\n - go to the edit prefs page (userprefs.cgi)\r\n - on the account settings bank, change your password (fill in old password, new\r\npassword, re-enter new password and click on submit)\r\n - Bugzilla comes back with a message to the effect that the changes have been\r\nsaved\r\n - click on any of the links where authentication is required (e.g.\r\nenter_bug.cgi, any of the other banks on user preferences - e.g. email settings)\r\n - Bugzilla requests reauthentication of the user \r\n\r\n(The SQL statement in the subroutine quietly_check_login in CGI.pl will set $ok\r\nto 0 if profiles.cryptpassword != logincookies.cryptpassword)\r\n \r\nSuggested fix:\r\nAdd a few lines to the subroutine SaveAccount to sync the cryptpassword fields\r\nin the tables profiles and logincookies when user passwords are changed."

However, the onLoad \r\nis part of the header constant passed to PutHeader.  PutHeader determines if \r\nshutdownhtml is defined and I'm not sure how the constant could be made \r\noptional or parsed out when shutdownhtml is defined.  I'm not familar enough \r\nwith PutHeader to know if this type of option would be valid for everywhere \r\nPutHeader is used.\r\n\r\nThe second fix (easier but not has optimal) is to modify the selectProduct code \r\nto exit if the form is not defined.

This means that Bugzilla must become more modular and \r\ntransparent about what fields it uses, and what values it allows for each field.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in working on such an app, I can rustle up some UI specs \r\nfor it."

That bug was marked fixed, and a comment \r\nsaid a new bug report should be opened for the problem with creating a database.  \r\nI haven't seen one yet, so this is it.\r\n\r\nI have a new patch I'll be posting shortly that fixes this. :)\r\n\r\nThe trick was just to remove the database name from the connect string.  It was \r\ntrying to log into the database server and select that database in one fell \r\nswoop, but that was a bad thing because we didn't know the database exists yet at \r\nthat point.  Now it logs into the server but doesn't select a database (which is \r\ngood because we're logging in at this point in order to see what databases are \r\nthere - we don't even know what's there yet).\r\n\r\nWhile I was messing with it, I also discovered that checksetup.pl got missed when \r\nwe did the 5.6 compatibility update on globals.pl, so that is also included in \r\nthis patch."

Therefore, someone could assign of all their votes to\r\na bug to confirm it and then remove them.  The intention was that 3 different\r\npeople should have to assign their votes.\r\n\r\nRemoving multiple voting was a kludgy workaround to ensure this.  Better would\r\nbe if it checked the number of voters was >= 3.  Even better if there was a\r\nconfirmation points system separate from the voting system.\r\n\r\nIn any case however, I do think whether to allow multiple votes should be an\r\nadmin choice.

            "handle CGI timeouts/aborts by aborting database calls"
        ],
        "FullDescription": "Some (many? all?) webservers abort CGI scripts if they output no text for long\r\nperiods of time.  In the case of Apache, this seems to be 300 seconds (5\r\nminutes).  For bugzilla.mozilla.org, this is probably a good value, because we\r\ndon't want the shadow db tied up for much longer than that (syncs cannot happen\r\nwhile searches are going on).\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the current mechanism for aborting the scripts doesn't cause\r\nany in-progress SELECTs to be aborted, which means that truly bad searches can\r\nand do continue for very long periods of time (hours even -- thus causing the\r\nshadow_db to remain out of sync).  Bugzilla needs to have abort-handlers that\r\nkill any appropriate running SQL calls (not necessarily all SQL calls, however,\r\nas we can't afford to leave the db in an inconsistent state).\r\n\r\nAfter much groveling through documentation (as well as the source code to\r\nApache), I think I've figured out the strategy for this.\r\n\r\nIt appears as though when CGIs are timed out by Apache, they get sent a SIGTERM\r\nand then three seconds later a SIGKILL, so this is an opportunity to cleanup.\r\nIdeally, we'd use the DBI statement cancel function.  Unfortunately, DBI::mysql\r\ndoesn't implement that, but presumably it could be added.  Alternately,  we\r\ncould find the $dbh->{'thread_id'} and then use system() to fork off a\r\nmysqladmin to kill the thread in question or even perhaps exec() mysqladmin in\r\nour own process slot.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that \"man DBI\" tells us that:\r\n\r\n       The first thing to say is that signal handling in Perl is\r\n       currently not safe. There is always a small risk of Perl\r\n       crashing and/or core dumping when, or after, handling a\r\n       signal.  (The risk was reduced with 5.004_04 but is still\r\n       present.)\r\n\r\nThere is also experimental code included with 5.005 (Thread::Signal) which runs\r\nwhich runs signal handlers on a separate thread.  However, 5.005 doesn't appear\r\nto me to be built multithreaded by default, so this seems overly risky.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we'll need to encourage folks to upgrade to 5.004_04.  And crashing\r\nin a signal handler will usually be better than running forever and leaving the\r\nshadow database out of sync.\r\n\r\nProbably the short-term fix is to just use a cronjob script that runs\r\n'mysqladmin processlist' every so often and kill off any long-running threads.\r\nIn fact, we're likely to want to do this anyway, given the signal-handler\r\nlossage.  It also wouldn't be difficult to patch MySQL to cause long_queries to\r\nbe killed when they hit the time limit.\r\n\r\nWith both of these quick fixes, though, I'm a bit afraid of one really evil\r\nSELECT (which might take > 5 mins on its own) significantly slowing down other\r\nSELECTs (which might only take 3 mins on their own) and then having the entire\r\nbatch of threads get killed).  Probably the answer to this (easy to implement in\r\nthe cronjob) is to never kill more than 1 thread per x minute interval, for some\r\nvalue of x."

It is a url to a file that\r\ndescribes what the milestones are for each product.  The url is used to create a\r\nlink when viewing a bug, the words \"Target Milestone\", next to the pull down\r\nlist, becomes a link that takes you to the page you specify in the \"Milestone\r\nURL:\".  I found that the words \"Milestone URL:\" were insufficient to describe\r\nthe above effects.  I think that if the notargetmilestone.html file that is\r\nincluded with bugzilla where the default entry in this field whenever a\r\ncomponenet was created, it would be more intuitive and clearer.\r\n1)  It would then create the link on every bug so that you wouldn't have the\r\nerratic behavior of \"Target Milestone\" sometimes being a link and other times\r\nnot.  Currently if the \"Milestone URL:\" field is empty, no link is created.\r\n2)  This could also be resolved by a short paragraph that describes what in blue\r\nblazes the \"Milestone URL:\" on the edit products page does.\r\nHope this helps clear this up.

The UI is as\r\nsimple as possible: a single text box. And it should be simple to use for\r\nnewbies: you can just enter some words and press return, and it will give you a\r\nlist of bugs.\r\nCurrently, this is a JS-based client-side tool, but it could be ported to perl\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nReasons for including it into CVS:\r\n==================================\r\nThe tool can be useful for all bugzilla installations. All mozilla-specific\r\nvalues are defined in a separate file (currently called \"localconfig.js\"), so it\r\nshould be easy to use it in other installations. It works fine for me so far,\r\nand I already prefer it over query.cgi more than 80 percent of the time. I\r\nconsider it production level quality. Checking it in will hopefully increase the\r\nchance that someone finds it useful and starts hacking on it.\r\n\r\nFiles involved:\r\n===============\r\nquicksearch.html     (query form with first part of the documentation)\r\nquicksearchhack.html (extended query form with second part of the documentation)\r\nquicksearch.js       (main part of the JS sources)\r\nlocalconfig.js       (installation-specific values)\r\noptional: index.html (for integration into the front page)\r\n\r\nI'm going to attach the files soon."

I don't give a hoot if Joe CC's himself or \r\nremoves himself, but I do care if\r\n\r\n1) someone CC's me on a bug -- it means they think I should look at it\r\n\r\n2) someone removes my CC from a bug -- why the f*** did they do that?\r\n\r\n3) someone adds or removes non-self CC's on bugs I'm otherwise watching -- keep \r\nan eye out for potential mischief.\r\n\r\nThere are too many Joes, so I and most everyone will turn off the CC \r\nnotifications. This means that in case 1) I may not see the bug for a while, \r\nnot until the next update. This will in turn result in some folks \r\nfiguring this out and so adding a comment at the same time they CC me, \r\ndefeating the purpose for folks who turn off the CC field. In the second case I \r\nmay simply never know, and will thus miss whatever I was watching for. And in \r\nthe third case I'll not notice that someone is munging my bugs.\r\n\r\nI think this needs re-thinking a bit."

This mean that\r\nthe resulting buglist will unexpectedly not be limited to matches to the \r\nselected component.\r\n\r\nCorresponding buglist.cgi URLs, including remembered queries, work as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click on the URL link above. \r\n2. Observe the form. The FIXED resolution, the Webtools product, \r\n   and the Bonsai component should be SELECTED.\r\n3. Click on Bonsai to select it.\r\n4. Submit the form.\r\n5. At the bottom of the buglist, click on the _Edit this query_ link.\r\n6. Observe the form again.\r\n7. Click the browser's [Back] button twice.\r\n8. Observe the form again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA. In steps 2, 6, and 8, the Component <SELECT> should have the \"Bonsai\"\r\n   <OPTION> SELECTED.\r\nB. If step 3 is left out, the buglist should contain only Bonsia bugs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA. In steps 2, 6, and 8, the Component <SELECT> *does not* have the \"Bonsai\"\r\n   (or any) <OPTION> SELECTED.\r\nB. If step 3 is left out, the buglist will contain bugs from all Webtools\r\n   components.\r\n\r\nTested with:\r\n* Both bugzilla.mozilla.org and landfill.tequilarista.org\r\n* NN4.76, current Mozilla, and IE5.5\r\n* Other Product/Component pairs\r\nSame results on each trial.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\nThis is a regression. It can cause a reasonably tightly crafted\r\nquery.cgi URL stored as a bookmark or a link on a webpage to end up\r\nrequesting a HUGE buglist if the user doesn't manually fix up the form\r\nbefore submitting it.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of \r\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/screening-duplicates.html\r\nthere is a set of links to generate buglists for Browser-General bugs \r\nsubmitted in the last week for all platforms, Linux-only, Mac-only, \r\nand a final link called /Customize/ that is the same query as a query.cgi,\r\nso the user can, for instance, change the date range or put something in\r\nthe Summary textbox. Right now, if the [Submit query] button is clicked,\r\nthe buglist will contain *all* Browser product bugs submitted in the last\r\nweek. Needless to say, before screening-duplicates.html went live all those\r\nlinks were tested and the buglist was limited to \"Browser-General\" as intended."

If there is now emailOwnerRemoveme for\r\na particular user, it should default to sending mail (the checkbox is checked in\r\neditprefs.cgi).\r\n\r\nWhile this logic may seem backwards, it allows the amount of data stored to be\r\nmuch smaller (an entry in the table is only created if a user doesn't want mail,\r\nif the later decide they do want mail on that type of change, simply remove the\r\nrow from the table)."

(Deletion of obsolete attachments could then be implemented later.)\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n- If a bug has any attachments, there should be an additional link near \"Create\r\na new attachment\" named \"Manage existing attachments\" (or perhaps \"Change\" or\r\n\"Edit\" instead of \"Manage\").\r\n- Clicking on this link should describe the current possibilities to change\r\nattachments and display a list of all attachments with a checkbox next to each,\r\nsimilar to the \"My Bugs\" page (showvotes.cgi). A checked checkbox would mean the\r\nattachment is marked \"obsolete\".\r\n- Everyone with \"can edit all bugs\" permission should be able to toggle the\r\n\"obsolete\" switch and submit the change. The submitter of an attachment should\r\nhave that permission, too.\r\n- In a bug view, only non-obsolete attachments should be shown by default. If\r\nthere are obsolete attachments for a bug, an additional link should appear to\r\nshow obsolete attachments, too. But even on that \"all attachments\" list,\r\nobsolete attachments should appear visually different from non-obsolete\r\nattachments. This could be done by applying a \"strike-through\" style to obsolete\r\nattachments. For a quick start, this page could be the same as the \"Manage\r\nattachments\" page.\r\n- Links like this: \"attachment 1234 [details]\" should have strike-through style iff the\r\nattachment is obsolete.\r\n\r\nImplementing this would require an additional field to be added to the\r\nattachments table: attachment.isobsolete, probably similar to attachment.ispatch"

An active group can be used in the same way groups are\r\nused in Bugzilla today.  An inactive group, on the other hand, has certain\r\nrestrictions on how it can be used that are intended to discourage further use\r\nof the group.  In particular, it is not possible to add bugs to an inactive\r\ngroup.  There may also be other restrictions on that group.\r\n\r\nI have created a patch that adds UI to the \"Edit Groups\" screen for\r\nde/activating groups and hides the UI in the \"Edit Bug\" screen for adding a bug\r\nto an inactive group.  The following SQL command adds the appropriate column to\r\nthe \"groups\" table, and I will attach a patch with my changes to bug_form.pl and\r\neditgroups.pl:\r\n\r\nALTER TABLE groups ADD COLUMN isactive TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;\r\n\r\n-myk"

However, inconsistently \"owner\" appears on editcomponents.cgi on\r\nthe components table (editcomponents.cgi?product=XXX) and on the specific\r\ncomponent form (editcomponents.cgi?product=XXX&component=YYY&action=edit).  I'm\r\nnot concerned with the schema, and I'm not sure about any other pages.\r\n\r\nSo basically, we should make this consistent.

This bug,\r\nhowever, I'm filing for someone to fix checksetup.pl so that it checks for the\r\npresence of CGI::Carp before executing (rather than dumping with an Unhandled\r\nException).  Here's a copy of the email I sent to the newsgroup:\r\n\r\nI'm going to file a bug on this in a few minutes...\r\n\r\nI'm running through my install docs and noted this bug in checksetup.pl on a \r\nvanilla install of Linux-Mandrake 8.0.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have \"CGI::Carp\" in the documentation as a \r\nprerequisite; I believe the assumption was that it was always installed with \r\nPerl -- but that ain't the case with Mandrake 8.0 and Perl 5.6.0.  Anybody \r\nfeel like hacking checksetup.pl to mark this as a dependency, while I get \r\nthis prerequisite listed in the documentation?\r\n\r\nI've verified this fixes the problem:\r\nbash# perl -MCPAN -e 'install \"CGI::Carp\"'\r\n\r\nHowever, this needs to be documented (my responsibility, I'm working on it) \r\nand fixed in checksetup.pl so that it checks for the presence of this module \r\n(not my job, but I'll do it if nobody else wants to).

I can send the apache logs also \r\nif needed.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information: I can look into this and see if I can get a patch out.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening:\r\n  Bugzilla does a check to see if it can output the \"Bugzilla is pondering your\r\n  Query\" message (which only works w/Mozilla and Netscape).  If it can, it does\r\n  If it can't, it spits out an incomplete header (so it can push more info later\r\n  if it needs to).  Somewhere after doing that, it checks to see if the \"exact\"\r\n  e-mail address matches one in the database, if it doen't the scripts errors\r\n  out and exists (telling the user that the \"exact\" e-mail address isn't in the\r\n  database).  The problem is that the error routine expects that the header has\r\n  already been completely outputted (the blank line has already happened).\r\n\r\nHow this patch fix it:\r\n  Before spitting out the error (and only if the error is gonna be spit out) it\r\n  sends a blank line.  This will complete the header and makes everyone happy.\r\n  This blank line won't have any adverse effects elsewhere because it'll only\r\n  show up in the HTML source, not on the page itself.\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a security issue, per se, 500 errors are something to avoid and\r\nthe fix is simple, so I'm marking it 2.14."

        "FullDescription": "It should be possible to use JavaScript to significantly improve the editing of\r\nthe keywords field (while maintaining backwards compatibility for users without\r\nJavaScript).\r\n\r\nAmong other solutions to this problem, it is possible to use JavaScript to\r\ncreate two drop-down menus next to the keywords field.  The first menu contains\r\na list of keywords currently in the field, while the second menu contains a list\r\nof all possible keywords.\r\n\r\nWhen the user selects a keyword from the first (\"remove\") menu, that keyword is\r\nremoved from the field.  When the user selects a keyword from the second (\"add\")\r\nmenu, that keyword is added to the field.  When the user edits the keyword field\r\nmanually, those edits are reflected in the \"remove\" menu, so that menu and the\r\nfield are always in sync.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements to this feature could include:\r\n\r\n1. Displaying tool-tip descriptions of keywords as the user mouses over them in\r\nthe menus or the field;\r\n2. Preventing a user from manually typing in an invalid keyword or from entering\r\na keyword twice (either manually or via the \"add\" menu); and \r\n3. Reducing UI clutter by only having an \"add\" menu (since removing a keyword is\r\narguably easy to accomplish manually, at least for those bugs whose list of\r\nkeywords is not longer than the length of the field).\r\n\r\nBut these enhancements are icing on the cake.  Even without them this feature\r\nwould make it significantly easier to edit the keywords field."

        "FullDescription": "This is an enhancement request (with patch providing the functionality) to add a\r\nnew 'index.cgi' script that can replace or supplement the existing index.html\r\nstatic html file.  By having the main index page be a cgi program rather than\r\nstatic html, we can take advantage of the configuration params (like bannerhtml)\r\nwhich makes it far easier for sites to customize the HTML associated with their\r\ndeployed version of Bugzilla.  I will attach to this bug two files: a new\r\n\"index.cgi\" file, and a patch to the defparams.pl file that adds a new\r\n\"index-template\" param that contains the html to be displayed on the index page.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the attached index.cgi file can (optionally) display a table of the\r\nproducts that are part of this Bugzilla instance.  If that table is shown, the\r\nproduct names can optionally be links to a query for all of the bugs for that\r\nproduct.  These optional features are turned off by default in order to emulate\r\nthe original behavior of Bugzilla as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not even close to a solution for separating UI from application\r\nlogic, it does help a bit by making it easier to upgrade Bugzilla without having\r\nto reimplement HTML changes in the index.html file.  A solution more along the\r\nlines of Bug 49225 in which XML is converted to HTML using a user-specified set\r\nof XSLT stylesheets would be preferable but more disruptive to implement.\r\n\r\nSee bug 2900 and bug 51100 for related issues."

        "FullDescription": "I recently developed an enhancement to Bugzilla to enable users to edit\r\ninformation about attachments and flag them with statuses.  Attachment statuses\r\nshow up in the attachment list when viewing a bug, and users can query for bugs\r\nwith certain attachment statuses.\r\n\r\nOther features of the tool include the ability to mark attachments invalid,\r\ncausing their descriptions to appear with strike-through style when viewing a\r\nbug, and the ability to view all attachments on one page in a series of iframes.\r\n\r\nI also created a second enhancement to Bugzilla to enable users to request\r\nchanges to data in Bugzilla from other users (f.e. setting a status on an\r\nattachment).  Requests generate email to the requestee and go into a queue\r\nstored in a database table.  When the requestee makes the change specified in\r\nthe request, the request is marked fulfilled in the database, and the requester\r\nis notified via email.  Users can also view the queue of pending requests to\r\ntrack them.\r\n\r\nBoth enhancements are implemented as a set of new files (module, script,\r\ntemplates) along with hooks into several existing Bugzilla scripts.  While both\r\nenhancements were developed to meet specific mozilla.org needs to track the\r\npatch review process, they both store their definitions (attachment statuses and\r\nrequest types) in database tables so they can be completely customized for other\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nI set up a test Bugzilla installation and filed a bug with several patches to\r\ndemonstrate the tools:\r\n\r\nhttp://landfill.tequilarista.org/myk/bzpacman/show_bug.cgi?id=3\r\n\r\nCreate an account for yourself if you want to experiment in a more significant way.\r\n\r\nhttp://landfill.tequilarista.org/myk/bzpacman/\r\n\r\nI am writing technical documentation on the enhancements and will post it as it\r\nbecomes available."

I can see\r\nvarious references to COUNT, but I suspect this is the fix:\r\n\r\n3.21.22: FIX COUNT(*) problems when the WHERE clause didn't match any records.\r\n(Bug from 3.21.17.)\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, our current version check (which I'm told is 3.22.5) should\r\nalready cover it.  But if we can't verify the fixed version, we could change the\r\nrequirement to v3.22.30."

        "FullDescription": "BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe Perforce Defect Tracking Integration <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/\r\np4dti/> integrates Bugzilla with the Perforce software configuration management \r\nsystem.  It replicates bugs between Bugzilla and Perforce so that users of \r\nPerforce can see and edit their bugs, and relate bugs to source changes.\r\n\r\nWhen someone changes a bug in Perforce, the P4DTI updates the bug in Bugzilla.  \r\nIt then needs to send e-mail notifications, which it does by running the Bugzilla \r\nprocessmail script.\r\n\r\nDEFECT DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nWhen the P4DTI runs the processmail script from Bugzilla 2.14, no e-mail is sent.  \r\nInstead, the following error message appears in the standard error:\r\n\r\nInsecure $ENV{BASH_ENV} while running with -T switch at ./processmail line 745 \\\r\n(#1)\r\n\r\n    (F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or\r\n    setgid script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS}, $ENV{CDPATH},\r\n    $ENV{ENV} or $ENV{BASH_ENV} are derived from data supplied (or\r\n    potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a\r\n    known value, using trustworthy data.  See perlsec.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCING THIS BUG\r\n\r\nYou probably don't want to install the P4DTI in order to confirm this bug.  \r\nInstead, run Bugzilla in an environment where some of the dangerous environment \r\nvariable have values.  You'll see that processmail doesn't send e-mail.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe processmail script is invoking the shell in order to open a pipe to sendmail.  \r\nIt does so with taint mode turned on (-T option to perl) but without clearing the \r\ndangerous environment variables.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\nClear the dangerous environment variables, as recommended in the perlsec manpage, \r\nby running\r\n\r\n      delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};\r\n\r\nbefore invoking the shell.\r\n\r\nI added this line to my processmail script and the P4DTI was then able to send e-\r\nmail notifications.\r\n\r\nOTHER NOTES\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't this bug show up in normal operation?  Perhaps because Bugzilla \r\nalways runs in an environment where the dangerous environment variables aren't \r\nset (e.g., in Apache under user \"nobody\").\r\n\r\nThis is related to bug 59349."

To show the difference you can simple comment out the SelectVisible line in \r\nbuglist.cgi and re-run your query. The PostgreSQL branch was basically unusable \r\nwithout this removal with a large amount of bugs (50,000+). So in the PostgreSQL \r\nbranch and now the Groups branch, I have altered to CanSeeBug to both take a \r\nsingle bug and a list of bugs returning the list of bugs that can be seen by the \r\ncurrent user. This only adds one or two extra SQL queries (one for PostgreSQL, \r\ntwo for Groups) to each buglist.cgi hit. For details you can check out the code from \r\neither the Bugzilla_PgSql_Branch or the Bugzilla_Groups_Branch. I would be \r\ninterested in seeing how this performs with 100,000+ bugs such as \r\nbugzilla.mozilla.org.

        ],
        "FullDescription": "We're using bugzilla at work for some internal development projects; thank you\r\nfor your continued work on this project.\r\n\r\nToday I noticed a security problem with the session management/authentication\r\nsystem. Bugzilla requires two cookies: one with the userid, the other with a\r\nsession number. The session value is sequential, and therefore (relatively)\r\neasily guessed. An attacker could theoretically assume someone else's identity\r\nby noting their email address (which is in all the tickets they touch) and\r\ntrying different session numbers til one works. E.G., log in at the beginning of\r\nthe day, note the session number, wait for the victim to post a change to a\r\nticket, log in again, check the session number, then try connecting with the\r\nvictim's email address as Bugzilla_login, trying all session numbers between the\r\nlater number and the earlier number as Bugzilla_logincookie, until one works.\r\n\r\nOn systems with fewer users (including high-profile projects like OpenSSH\r\n[bugzilla.mindrot.org]), the attack would be easier to accomplish.\r\n\r\nSuggested improvements:\r\n\r\nOption One (easiest to retrofit): shared secret. \r\n\r\nAdd another configuration variable (populated by a random value when Bugzilla is\r\ninstalled) for a site-wide shared secret. Set another cookie, Bugzilla_token,\r\nwhich is something like the hexadecimal MD5 or SHA hash of\r\n\"${sessionid}-${secret}-${logintime}\". (Might also want to add the User-Agent\r\nrequest header value sent by the browser used at login time. The login time is\r\ncritical -- without login time, a user could brute-force the secret by looking\r\nat their own cookies, making the attack process trivially more complex [the\r\nattacker would only have to calculate the hash for each sessionid to be\r\nattempted].) The access control code would use Bugzilla_logincookie to find the\r\nuser's time of login, to calculate the expected Bugzilla_token value. No match\r\n== security error message. Disadvantage: someone with read access (no write\r\nprivileges needed) to the bugzilla server config could obtain the shared secret\r\nand use it to attack sessions\r\n\r\nOption Two (preferred, requires database change): per-session random tokens\r\n\r\nAdd a third cookie, Bugzilla_token. Add a column to the session table,\r\ntokenhash. When a session is initiated, obtain/generate some random data. Store\r\na seeded MD5  or SHA hash of that data to the session table, and set the cookie\r\nto contain the hexadecimal representation of the data itself. The access control\r\ncode would use Bugzilla_logincookie to find the salt for the stored hash, use\r\nthe provided Bugzilla_token data to calculate the hash of the client-provided\r\ndata with that salt, and see if the result matches the stored salted hash. No\r\nmatch == security error message. Advantage: an attacker would have to be able to\r\ncontrol/predict the random number generation to hijack a session. Disadvantage:\r\nwould require modifications to database schema, making this improvment a more\r\ndifficult upgrade for running sites to use.\r\n\r\nOption Two Minus (secure but ugly hack): abusing database definitions\r\n\r\nYou could probably wedge the per-session salted hash described in Option Two\r\ninside some other column in the session table, e.g. in the userid/email column\r\nstore \"${saltedhash}\\t${email}\" and then parse them as needed. No database\r\nchanges (== easy upgrades for running sites), but possibly gobs of code changes,\r\nand a really awful abuse of the database design. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Option One now, Option Two later\r\n\r\nWhile not as strong as Option Two, Option One should dramatically improve the\r\nsecurity of the cookie authentication mechanism, and would be an easy\r\npatch/upgrade for current users. Option Two would be preferable in the long\r\nterm, though.\r\n"

            "Support database transactions.",
            "Implement database transactions across Bugzilla"
        ],
        "FullDescription": "Spun off of bug #98304.\r\n\r\nSome databases support the notion of transactions, where an operation is\r\nconsidered to be atomic.  Apparently PostgreSQL has good support for them -\r\nMySQL I believe supports them but not well.\r\n\r\nTransactions have two main benefits that I see:\r\n\r\n- When a transaction contains a write operation is occuring, all other\r\ntransactions will see the database either as is was at the start, or as it was\r\nat the end.  Failures of any sort will not result in a \"corrupted\" database\r\nwhere half a transaction was applied.\r\n\r\nBug #104589 makes this problem serious, but even if we fix that transactions are\r\nstill a good idea for robustness purposes.  Computers can crash and software can\r\nhave bugs.\r\n\r\n- Read-only operations should never be denied - they can always use the last\r\ncopy of the database that was before any other transactions begun, which is\r\nguaranteed to be consistent by the definition of transactions.  This means the\r\nshadow database is unnecessary as a performance improvement.\r\n\r\nI don't see that introducing transactions into the codebase would be very\r\ndifficult.  The API should be rather simple.\r\n\r\nYou need the calls BeginTransaction, CommitTransaction.  A shorthand call\r\nPerformTransaction that performs a list of SQL statements would also be good\r\nwhen you know up front what you want to do.\r\n\r\nEssentially I think we should be able to add these calls in a bit at a time.  If\r\nthe database in use does not support transactions there is no great loss.  In\r\nthis case the calls will essentially be no-ops and there is no loss over what we\r\nhad before.\r\n\r\nI don't provide a RollbackTransaction call for this reason - not\r\nall databases will support it and we must not expect them to.\r\n\r\nI also think BeginTransaction and CommitTransaction provide another benefit - it\r\nis a nice solution to bug #104589, users closing the window shouldn't terminate\r\nscripts.  A script should NEVER terminate during a transaction.  We can\r\nimplement this notion of \"transaction\" even in databases that don't support\r\ntransactions.  Indeed, I'm not sure we need to prevent script termination\r\noutside of transactions at all.\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue of locking.\r\n\r\nWrite locks are still probably useful in databases with transactions - without\r\nthem a transaction can fail because it clashes in the typical \"multiple writers\"\r\nsituation, and the transaction would need to be reapplied.  We need to decide\r\nwhether the complexity of retrying is better than the possibility of deadlocks\r\nthat comes with locking.  The former could be hidden away in a call such as\r\nPerformTransaction, but would need to be considered for CommitTransaction.\r\n\r\nRead locks are unnecessary for transactions in PostgreSQL, since it will\r\nmaintain an old copy of the data for the reader.  So if a traditional read lock\r\nwas done on such a database, it would block writers when there is no particular\r\nneed to.  I'm not sure whether PostgreSQL would block writers or just ignore\r\nignore the locks.  If the former, we need to make sure read locks are only done\r\nfor non-transaction mode.\r\n\r\nSo the question here is essential, is locking something that BeginTransaction\r\nworries about?  If read locks would block writers, it needs to be, as it can\r\ndecide whether to do the read locks.  If we want to do retrying sometimes\r\ninstead of write locks, the same applies.  The locks could be passed as a\r\nparameter to BeginTransaction and it would decide what to do.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it isn't feasible for BeginTransaction to automatically compute\r\nwhat to lock at the start if necessary since it doesn't know what is going to\r\nhappen in the transaction - PerformTransaction is not constrained in that way\r\nand so perhaps could."

Mainly due to\r\nchanging the pr parser to be based on the one in gnatsweb, which is absurdly\r\nfast.\r\nIf you don't need any of the below, just replacing the parser will probably buy\r\nyou a 20x speedup (i didn't do speed testing till i was finished, but its a bit\r\nslower than it was when i first replaced the parser)\r\n\r\nChunks audit trail into separate comments, with the right From's, times, etc.\r\n\r\nHandles followup emails that are in the report, with the right From's, times,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nProperly handles duplicates, adding the standard bugzilla duplicate message.\r\n\r\nExtracts and handles gnatsweb attachments, as well as uuencoded attachments\r\nappearing in either followup emails, the how-to-repeat field, etc.  Replaces\r\nthem with a message to look at the attachments list, and adds the standard\r\n\"Created an attachment\" message that bugzilla uses.  Handling them includes\r\ngiving them the right name and mime-type. \"attachments\" means multiple\r\nuuencoded things/gnatsweb attachments are handled properly.\r\n\r\nHandles reopened bug reports.\r\n\r\nBuilds the cc list from the people who have commented on the report, and the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\nOther things i've forgotten, i'm sure (I fixed many bugs regarding parsing of\r\nemail addresses, etc)\r\n\r\nIt's hard, at first glance, to tell the result from a bugzilla database built\r\nfrom scratch.\r\n\r\nThe patch is actually larger than gnats2bz.pl currently.\r\n\r\nIt has a *few* gcc specific things that are easy to remove: \r\n1.  we don't use op_sys and rep_platform, since you can build on any host, for\r\nany build os, for any target.  Thus, we use a build, host, and target field\r\nwith the triplet (ie i686-pc-linux-gnu) in them.\r\n2.  Because almost all of our attachments are text, and large text at that\r\n(preprocessed source files), all attachments data is compressed with \r\nCompress::Zlib.  \r\nThis is also because noone will ever want to full-text search it.\r\n\r\nRemoving these two is a matter of just changing a few lines.\r\n\r\nYou can see the result (no changes, this is what running the script gives you)\r\nat www.dberlin.org/bugzilla-2.14"

This is because the enum value is invalid. Not sure how that happened,\r\nand it occurs on bmo as well. However, the last bug # affected by this on bmo is\r\nbug 56209, so whatever the corruption this was has presumably been fixed.\r\n\r\nOn the newsgroup, I said that we should still output empty values, because of\r\nthis. I think I've changed my mind - bugzilla is not guarenteed to give correct\r\ninformation if sanity checks fail (Of course, they should never be allowed to\r\nfail, but theres not much option with mysql). I've therefore added a sanity\r\ncheck for this so that we do fail the checks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, an op_sys of '' isn't likely to be valid on the other end."

It is likely that\r\nb.m.o will update to 2.16, and stay there. Therefore, to get this on b.m.o,\r\nthey'll have to apply the patch by hand. So, it would be ideal if these tweaks\r\nwere part of Bugzilla 2.16, even if the new template isn't.\r\n\r\nThe tweaks are:\r\n- setting the variable user_agent to the user-agent string when we initialise\r\n$vars. This is generally useful.\r\n- choose-product.tmpl passing the format parameter through to its target.\r\n- the simple buglist format saying \"Zarro Boogs\", instead of nothing, if no bugs\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nI have simple patches for all of these, but want to discuss whether any of them\r\nare controversial first :-)"

Because they are all in one file,\r\nit is possible to slot a new enter_bug template into default but not a new\r\npost_bug template, and therefore editing will always be required.  I would much\r\nprefer if you could slot in templates.\r\n\r\nSo basically each enter_bug template would pass a format name through to\r\npost_bug.cgi and post_bug.cgi would call the appropriate\r\ncomment-format.txt.tmpl.  The normal template would be comment-simple.txt.tmpl\r\nor comment-unprocessed.txt.tmpl.  This strikes me as easy for 2.16, and I think\r\nits worth doing before our first release of this feature."

Currently, we have the problem noted on landfill where\r\nif you try to enter a bug when you're not logged in, and we're scheduled rebuild\r\nthe versioncache, then we clear the token table first. Rebuilding the\r\nversioncache calls ConnectToDB, and if you're logged in with a non-0 groupset we\r\ncall userInGroup, which also connects to the db.\r\n\r\nThe token code doesn't, and so we fail when making a db query to do the updates\r\n\r\nThis is thus a 2.16 blocker.\r\n\r\nThe easy solution is just to always connectToDatabase at the top of scripts, and\r\nnever anywhere else. This will cause a sperious connection on pages which don't\r\notherwise need the versioncache, when a person isn't logged in (wince then we\r\nwouldn't need them for the footer, either). I think that the product selection\r\npart of enter_bug.cgi is the only one of those we have, so I think we can live\r\nwith that...\r\n\r\nThis blocks the replication bug, bug 124589, because there I've changed\r\nConnectToDatabase() to mean 'connect to the real db' instead of the current\r\nbehaviour of returning if we already have a connection. Yes, I could make\r\nConnectoToDatabase with no args only connect if we're not connected, but I think\r\nthat its easier to just remove the calls from helper functions, which are\r\nscattered thoguhtout the code, as seen from the current issue with enter_bug.\r\n\r\nMattyT has longer-term plans for a transaction API.

Bugzilla should not use getSelection or any other names\r\nsuch as this, and Mozilla should either prevent getSelection from being modified\r\nby code like this, or not break when this happens.

The same applies to form fields.\r\nThis has great advantages for code reuse and generalisation.\r\n- This rule may be broken on rare occasions for template variables, where\r\ndejargonification and understandability are paramount.\r\n\r\n- variables, including template variables, should be all lower-case, and\r\nunderscore_separated if separators are required. e.g. var show_bug;\r\n- CGI parameters should also be all lower-case, but word are simply concatenated\r\ntogether, e.g. &rescanall=1.\r\n- Functions should use StudlyCaps, with a leading capital. e.g. SendSQL().\r\n(There is a dichotomy here; another valid choice would be as variables -\r\nlower-case and underscore_separated. But I suggest there's value in having them\r\ndifferent from variables.).\r\n- Filehandles should be ALLCAPS.\r\n\r\nThere are already rules for template naming. New CGI names should also follow\r\nthis rule - lower-case, and hyphen separated.\r\n\r\nExisting code shouldn't be changed to conform to this standard unless it's being\r\nspanked already."

These are simple cases and have lead to\r\nduplicate entries being made.\r\n\r\nBugzilla requires a thesaurus or controlled vocabulary feature provided by the\r\nbetter text retrieval systems. So when the user enters \"animated\" a search is\r\nmade for \"animated or animation or animate\" depending upon what Use For/Related\r\n terms are entered for animated/animation."

Scripts may not\r\nimplement both kinds of variations in a single file, at least not until someone\r\nimplements a data structure for storing variations that indexes them by both\r\nformat name and extension (there is no need for this now, and it's unclear that\r\nthere ever will be, but the scheme above does not do anything to prohibit its\r\nimplementation if anyone ever discovers a reason to do it).\r\n\r\nBugzilla should fail gracefully when it cannot find the requested variation.\r\nBugzilla should have ways for installations and users to specify default variations."

We set the size, using a style attribute. Mozilla\r\nseems to ignore the rows attribute, but I need to check if that is guarenteed.\r\nThat page only wokrs in mozilla ATM, so I'm not worried about other browsers.\r\n\r\nThe mimetype warnings are all on the fact that we use text/javascript instead of\r\napplication/x-javascript. Was this a deliberate decision made for old IE\r\nversions, or something? If not, I'll fix those, too.\r\n\r\nThis is for 2.18, not 2.16, although the account/email/confirm.html.tmpl part\r\n(<input type=\"input\">) may need to go into 2.16, since I can imagine browsers\r\nhaving issues with that.\r\n\r\nMost of the fixes are obvious (& -> amp;, adding action attribute to <form>s,\r\nand alt to <img> and so on). Those that aren't include:\r\n\r\nglobal/useful-links.html.tmpl: gmuck warns about inconcistant quote style, so I\r\nchanged these to use \" instead of ' (they were \" because of how we were quoting\r\nfor TT)\r\n\r\nsearch/form.html.tmpl: gmuck picked up on:\r\n\r\n[%# Note: the <form> tag is unclosed at the end of this template %]\r\n\r\nas not having an action attribute. Since the opening isn't in this template, and\r\nonly one template uses this particular template, I think its a fairly silly\r\ncomment, so I removed it. I care because I want gmuck to become part of the\r\ntests - see bug 148487.

[...]\"  Either way, seems like\r\nsomething's wrong.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; it would be kind of cool if I could confirm my own reports.\r\n But I don't think developers would consider this \"cool.\"  I am aware of Bug\r\n95579 and Bug 90619, but 1) I suspect this is a regression (recent upgrade) and\r\nthose bugs are pretty old; and 2) I don't see the stuff about being able to mark\r\na bug NEW discussed anywhere in either of those two bugs.  I also understand the\r\nnotion that users ought to be able to reopen bugs they reported, mark their own\r\nreports duplicates of others, and so forth, but I am pretty sure this does not\r\nfall under \"so forth\".\r\nI'll let someone who _should_ be allowed to confirm do so and set it to block\r\nBug 150783 if that is deemed necessary (and if this report is not invalid in the\r\nfirst place).  :)  Couldn't find that anyone else had reported this yet."

As I'm not\r\nintimately familiar with Bugzilla code, I only made a cursory attempt to fix the\r\nproblem, but came up empty.  What we have found is that if you are only sorting\r\non one index (for example order=bugs.priority), you're fine, but if you have two\r\nor more (for example order=bugs.bug_severity%2C%20bugs.priority), then the sort\r\ndoes not occur for either index.  As soon as I backed out this particular change\r\n(not the whole 2.14.2 patch) sorting was returned to us.  Since this bug report\r\nis the verbatim patch that I found, I decided to report it here."

It should, in some form.\r\n\r\nHere is some discussion from the webtools newsgroup:\r\n\r\n=======================\r\n[jesse:]\r\nBtw, we should remove the \"alias\" field before it becomes \r\nimpossible to change the bug id boxes to search boxes.  \r\nThe alias field is a workaround for searches being slow,  \r\nand searches will soon become faster.\r\n=======================\r\n[afranke:]\r\nThere is an alternative solution: Enable quicksearch to find\r\nbugs by their aliases (or substrings of their aliases). \r\nCurrently this can only be implemented as a special\r\nprefix, e.g. alias:bmo-regressions ,which would defeat\r\nmost of the usability win. But when the perl port to\r\nquicksearch is checked, then it could first check whether one \r\nof the non-prefixed word-fragments entered in the quicksearch \r\nbox occurs as a substring in some alias for a bug, and display \r\nthe matches at the top of the result page, before the \"normal\" \r\nquery results. And if you enter only a single string and there \r\nexists a bug with exactly that alias, then the \"normal\" query \r\ndoes not need to be executed anymore because the bug is probably \r\nthe one the user is looking for. In this case, there can be a \r\nlink on the result page that executes the normal quicksearch\r\nquery, without looking for aliases again.\r\n=====================\r\n[gerv:]\r\nA simpler alternative to your alternative - restrict aliases to the set \r\n[A-Za-z-_] (if they aren't already) and then do an alias lookup first if \r\nthe search is a single word.\r\n=====================\r\n[afranke:]\r\nYes, but you still need the perl port of quicksearch \r\nfor this, because from JS you can't find out whether\r\nthe returned result from show_bug.cgi?id=foo is a \r\nbug view or a not-found error message, and fall back\r\nto the normal quicksearch in the latter case. Or can\r\nyou do this? How? Btw, the perl-port checkin thing is\r\nin bug 70907.\r\n\r\n(I still think substring search in the aliases is better\r\nthan just exact lookup because e.g. you will want to\r\nhit bmo-regressions if you type in bmo, or regressions,\r\nor even regression.)"

Examples include specifying the component/version/milestone when a\r\nproduct is changed, the user logging in, resolving \"mid-air collisions\",\r\nand confirming duplicates.\r\n\r\nIn that intermediate page, Bugzilla needs to save the changes the user\r\nwanted to make.  However, for fields with multiple values, e.g., the CC\r\nlists, these values are munged.  All the values are concatenated together\r\ninto one value.\r\n\r\nTo see this in action, take a bug with CCs.  Change the product\r\nand remove a couple of CCs at the same time, so you get the \"verify\r\ncomponent/version/milestone\" page.  Once you specify these values, you\r\nget an error, because \"user1@domain.comuser2@domain.netuser3@example.org\"\r\nis not a registered Bugzilla account.\r\n\r\nNote that this was noticed in bug 101056.

It still exists in the other cases.\r\n\r\nI discovered this bug in 2.14, but it still exists in 2.16.\r\n\r\nI have a fix for this, and I will be submitting them."

Run this query\r\n( ) Load my remembered query:   \r\n( ) Run my remembered query:\r\n( ) Forget my remembered query:\r\n\r\n( ) Remember this as my default query\r\n( ) Remember this query, and name it:\r\n      [x] and put it in my page footer\r\n\r\nSort results by: [          ^]  [Search]\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn the top the search button is intuitive and does what it says, but i think\r\nthat something has to be done with [Search] at bottom:\r\nthe problem is, that in fact \"Search\" will be performed only, if you tick \"run\r\nthis query\". In other cases it will load, forget, remember, run remembered, aso. \r\nAlso \"run this query\" is not quite \"search\" (because then the logic sentence is\r\n\"search run this query\" ) - it's more like \"do\" or \"ok\"\r\n\r\nI suggest to rename this button to 'Ok' or 'Do it!' or 'I will feel buggy\r\ntomorrow' (um, ignore the last one). And also - to split the form submit logic\r\ninto \"Search\" and \"Do the other things\" (now, if i check everything at bottom,\r\npress the search button on top, it will do the same what at bottom)\r\n\r\np.s. also - right now i checked bugzilla tip\r\n(http://landfill.tequilarista.org/bugzilla-tip/query.cgi)\r\n, and if it will look like what it looks now, then i suggest to remove(hide) the\r\nradio \"run this search\" and leave the text, because there is no sence for radio\r\nbutton with only one option (unless it's dynamic)"

The \"edit\" links would be a dropdown too.\r\n\r\nquery.cgi's knob would then be vastly simplified to:\r\n\r\n( Search )\r\n   [ ] and remember these as my default search options\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\"My Bugs\" becomes a default entry in the stored queries table, inserted at\r\naccount creation time, instead of being hard-coded.\r\n\r\nAll queries appear in the footer, the links toolbar, and nowhere else, so\r\nlinkinfooter goes away, along with its UI on userprefs.cgi.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n- No loss of function\r\n- Confusion about doing an action _and_ running the search is avoided\r\n- Queries are as easy to run as before (one click with JS)\r\n- Footer is simpler\r\n- Search page knob is much simpler\r\n- User preferences are simpler\r\n- Admin config is a bit simpler (mybugslink goes)\r\n- You can refine a search, and then remember it on the results page when it's\r\n  correct\r\n"

Where can I get commercial support for Bugzilla?\r\n  should make reference to http://www.buzilla.org/consulting.html\r\n\r\nA.1.4 Who uses Bugzilla?\r\n  remove AtHome... they don't exist anymore, I think :)\r\n\r\nA.1.5 Who maintains Bugzilla?\r\n  my address is now justdave@netscape.com :)\r\n\r\nA.1.8 Why MySQL?\r\n  support for both Postgres and Sybase is planned for 2.18.\r\n\r\nA.2.3 multiple products\r\n  the 55 group limit is gone.  It's now only limited to the number of unique\r\nkeys available in the database (smallint, or about 32 thousand)\r\n\r\nA.2.5 attachment types\r\n  Bugzilla will now autodetect the attachment mime-type based on what your web\r\nbrowser thinks the file is when you upload it.\r\n\r\nA.2.7 reporting\r\n  The reporting system just got a complete overhaul.  I'm not sure what to\r\nchange here, but I know it can do a lot more than it used to.\r\n\r\nA.2.11 import/export\r\n  buglist.cgi now allows output in both RDF and CSV formats (CSV can be imported\r\ninto Excel).  There is a link at the bottom of the page for redisplaying the\r\npage in CSV format.  For RDF you need to add &ctype=rdf on the end of the URL\r\n(RDF is intended to only be machine readable, so it's assuming a program would\r\nbe accessing that URL)\r\n  The report system now allows CSV output of several of the reports, as well.\r\n\r\nA.2.12 translated/localized versions\r\n  The answer to this is now Yes.  An up-to-date list of the known translations\r\ncan always be found at http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html in the \"Localized\r\ntemplates\" section.\r\n\r\nA.2.13 Can the user create and save reports...\r\n  Yes. No.  Yes (sort of - CSV format can be read by Excel)\r\n\r\nA.4.2 Need bugzilla to only send mail to me\r\n  The name of the param is \"newchangedmail\"\r\n\r\nA.5.1 Bugzilla with Oracle?\r\n  RedHat Bugzilla has been updated to 2.17.1 and supports Postgres, not Oracle.\r\nRedHat no longer supports the Oracle version.  Their Postgres code will be\r\ngetting merged with mozilla.org Bugzilla (so it will support both MySQL and\r\nPostgres) within the next month.  The work we are doing towards getting Bugzilla\r\nto work with Postgres and Sybase should make it much easier for someone else to\r\nport it to Oracle later if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nA.5.3 Modifying the database\r\n  the \"mysql\" command-line shell is a bit easier to use than running everything\r\nthrough mysqladmin.  Might not hurt to mention that instead.  There are various\r\nGUI MySQL admin programs floating around now, too.  You can find several of them\r\nfor Windows and Mac by searching for \"mysql\" on versiontracker.com\r\n\r\nA.5.4 Password error in mysql 3.23.(29/30)\r\n  This entry is obsolete.  Bugzilla a) now requires a newer version of MySQL\r\nthan that, and b) no longer uses MySQL's crypt() function anyway (uses Perl's\r\ninstead)\r\n\r\nA.5.5 Can't connect to MySQL\r\n  You should add to this that if this solves their problem then they need to\r\nredo their permissions for the user Bugzilla is connecting as within MySQL.\r\n\r\nA.7.5 attachment names are .cgi\r\n  In 2.17.1 you can now edit the filena"

Now the steps 2-4 can be repeated to open more and more windows for the current instance and every time Thunderbird closes all windows.\r\nOnly the manual deletion of the window-JSONs in the profile's \"session.json\" reverts the instance to one window.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThunderbird closes ALL windows, not only the selected one.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nOnly the selected window should close and the remaining windows should stay opened.\r\nThus draging tabs outer the current window scope should open stand-alone windows.\n\nThe same happens when you use Exit from menu. With draw in title bar the close button is using \"cmd_quit\" like Exit in menu. This is on every Windows system with draw in title bar except Vista/Win7 Aero. On Aero the native buttons with their system function is used. It exists also \"cmd_close\" but this closes only one tab after the other until the last tab is closed."

After checking it on my laptop (both the desktop and laptop run Windows), it became clear it wasn't a graphics card bug. I'm not sure if they're supposed to be there, but the really seem out-of-place. After looking at them for a while, I suppose they *kinda* look like the dividers in the menu bar, but they still seem fairly out-of-place. Perhaps someone should remove them in the next update?\n\nAlso the Firefox button will change to this glyph, see: http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/australis-designSpecs/australis-designSpecs-windows7-mainWindow.html. Other OS and applications are also using this symbol for menus and this will help to faster recognize there is a menu behind this button.\r\n\r\nI close this bug with WONTFIX because of the reasoning I wrote.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen this bug if you think you have a better solution which also Firefox will use."

        "FullDescription": "STR:\r\n- Search for an email address with totobimbo, with Gandi & Hover checked: failure (most of the time) at first search. \r\n- Deselect one of the providers and run search again: successful (even if Gandi results are broken - they seem to be expecting 2 words search query and use the second for the domain name )\r\n- Reselect the previously deselected provider and run the search again: success\n\nI worked through this with Sancus this morning. We reduced it down to one main issue, and one minor issue that we want to follow-up on as well (plus one issue already fixed):\r\n\r\n* The main issue is that the account provisioning providers are being talked to in an synchronous fashion. At the moment, hover is taking about 7.5 - 8.5 seconds to respond, gandi is between 1 - 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nThunderbird has a built in timeout of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nHence, there are various times when we're taking up to about 11/12 seconds to get a result, and so Thunderbird is timing out. I'm guessing about 30 - 50% of the time we could be getting timeouts at the moment. We have no history here, so we don't know how long we've been in this state.\r\n\r\nSancus is planning on changing broker-live to run the providers as async (something that was originally intended), so once that is done, we should be a lot less likely to time out.\r\n\r\n* The minor issue, is that broker-live also has a 10 second timeout on individual results, given that Thunderbird also has 10 seconds, that leaves no time for actual processing in the server picks up the timeout case, i.e. we could be in the state where a provider has timed out, but another provider has returned the results which broker-live would return, but Thunderbird would itself have timed out leaving the user with no results.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix here is to bump Thunderbird's timeout a little, so that it exceeds broker-live's timeout.\r\n\r\nGiven the times we're seeing for results to be returned on individual providers, I don't think we need to push this tweak out quick for 17.0, we can include it in the next round of security releases, as an worst case improvement.\r\n\r\n* The fixed issue is that when requesting results for only one provider, broker-live was still asking both/all providers (in the synchronous fashion as mentioned above).\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed on broker-live and, for instance, we're generally seeing 1-3 seconds on results from Gandi where it was around 10 seconds (and sometimes timing out) before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo at the moment, searches on individual providers should now return results all of the time, and searches on both providers may time out - but Sancus will look at fixing that later today."

Feedback welcome of course :).\r\n\r\nThe relevant specs are:\r\nhttp://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#sasl\r\n\"If the receiving entity is capable of SASL negotiation, it MUST advertise one or more authentication mechanisms within a <mechanisms/> element qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' namespace in reply to the opening stream tag received from the initiating entity (if the opening stream tag included the 'version' attribute set to a value of at least \"1.0\").\"\r\n\r\nand http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0078.html#streamfeature\r\n\"It may be desirable for a server to advertise support for non-SASL authentication as a stream feature. The namespace for reporting support within <stream:features/> is \"http://jabber.org/features/iq-auth\". Upon receiving a stream header qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace, a server that returns stream features SHOULD also announce support for non-SASL authentication by including the relevant stream feature.\""

No message in the Rrror console. From looking at the code the button is wrapped inside #ifdef HAVE_SHELL_SERVICE but that seems to be set for linux-gtk2 globally. I have it set but getting the shell-service throws and exception. The code hides the exception and exits cleanly. I have gconf installed but maybe it does not work.\r\n\r\nI think the buttons should not be exposed if we can know if it will work, via checking the shell-service.\nThis patch hides the button and the checkbox, because also the \"search intergration\" checkbox in the same groupbox is hidden on unsupported systems. Or is it better to just disable it?\n\nMy take would be it's better to disable. Otherwise someone knowing where it is would be looking all over the place in vain. Also, because it should be possible to make it work by installing whatever packages are needed."

When the selector is focused, currently pressing enter starts the edit of the status message. Shouldn't the down arrow open the status type popup menu?\r\n- After finishing to edit the status message, there's no focused element in the document any more (pressing the tab key does nothing); I think we need a focus call, like the one we have when finishing the rename of a contact.\r\n- When the status type is \"Offline\", the status message isn't editable, so we shouldn't display the textbox border while hovering it.\n\nThis does all the things listed in comment 0 + disables the \"Show Accounts\" button of the chat toolbar if there's no account. The \"Get started\" button in the middle of the main part of the chat tab in that case is much more visible, and opens directly the account wizard instead of the accounts status dialog which could be confusing when there's no account (it's not broken though)."

In this case, conversations are opened up with each contact, and the chat tab is opened to focus on the conversation with the last contact in the selection.\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n\r\nUser has selected no contacts that are online via the IM component.

On Win7 and OSX this is easy with only one button height. On XP and Linux with the big and small icons it's a little bit trickier.\r\n\r\nI set the :only-of-type to apply only when one toolbar is set. When two toolbars are set they are taller than the minimum height and the margins aren't needed. The only drawback with this is, when two toolbars are defined (with Add toolbar in Customize window) and one is hidden, then the only visible toolbar has no margins.

This can happen with the current set-up if a user forwards an attachment to the wrong party, and is a risk inherent in email.\r\n\r\nAn added risk of this system is that the file is publicly available and not limited in accessibility to those who can access the message itself. This is like 'security by obscurity', which is not ideal, but acceptable in this case since users know the file will be uploaded to a sharing service.\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Make it clear to users that uploaded files will be world-readable (to members of the world who know where to find it)."

(URL pasted below). &nbsp;This announcement demonstrates great momentum for the project and a groundswell of support in the industry for our efforts. &nbsp;I know this progress has taken tremendous energy from many of you and many throughout our community - thank-you! &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Key highlights of this press release include the fact that we'll be using Firefox branding on this new mobile operating system (OS); the confirmation that we are on track with Telefonica, Qualcomm and the OEM partners to deliver the first devices in early 2013; and a number of new operator partners who are interested in supporting the Firefox OS at some point in the future.<br /> <br /> On the last item, please understand that this does not mean that all of the operators mentioned are committed to immediately delivering devices, but it does mean that we are in active discussions with them, and that they support our general strategic direction. It is important at this stage in our delivery that we not confuse the market by incorrectly stating the status of any of our partners or the delivery of various milestones of the project so I ask for your continued help to involve the project team and/or the press team before you comment (tweet, blog, etc) publicly. &nbsp;We just want to make sure we all comment accurately. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> We have the opportunity to do something truly disruptive and positive for consumers and the mobile industry with the Firefox OS, just like we did with the Firefox browser on the desktop.

The release binary builders already have the relevant items set in the environment."

I don't have a clear understanding of how this list is needed.\r\n\r\n* I won't pretend to understand all the usages of kScreenNameProperty, except http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/addrbook/src/nsAbAddressCollector.cpp#278 (and we can probably do the same for @gmail.com @googlemail.com, @hotmail, @msn, and @live addresses)\r\n\r\n* Are AIM screen names stored in ldap? http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/mailnews.js#311 Do we need something similar for other IM services?\r\n\r\n* I also noticed http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/addrbook/src/nsAbOSXUtils.mm#136 that seems to be using Apple-defined constants to import things from the OS X address book. There are more similar constants documented at https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/AddressBook/C/ABPersonRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/kABAIMInstantProperty and apparently OS X 10.7 supports even more: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/AddressBook/C/ABPersonRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/data/kABInstantMessageServiceAIM\r\n\r\n\r\nBlake, the current address book shows the Screen Name in the card summary that's visible in the bottom part of the address book window when selecting a card. Do we need to change this to show all the IM fields that have a value?\r\n\r\nThere's currently an \"Instant Message\" context menu items on contacts (and it's also a toolbar button; hidden by default though) that just takes the AIM screen name and loads an aim:goim?screenname=<screenname> url through the external protocol service. I assume we want to change that, but what's the new expected behavior? Do we take into account which accounts the user has configured? The presence information we have of the contact? I don't think there's a known typical URL for all the IM services I have listed in the new \"Chat\" tab that this patch adds."

I found the problem with version 12.0.1 (for Windows and Mac).  I tried Earlybird (14.0a2) for Windows but it was still broken.\r\n\r\nI did the following steps:\r\n(Assume an (internal) SMTP server running services on standard port 25/465/587)\r\n\r\n* Select Account Settings -> Account Actions -> Add Mail Account\r\n* Enter a name and Email address, and click \"Continue\"\r\n* Thunderbird found configuration by trying common server names\r\n* Click \"Manual config\" and change outgoing SSL setting from \"STARTTLS\" to \"SSL/TLS\"\r\n  (The port number was automatically changed from 587 to 465)\r\n* Click \"Re-test\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThunderbird reported \"Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account\".\r\n\r\nIf I reverted outgoing SSL setting to \"STARTTLS\" and clicked \"Re-test\", Thunderbird reported \"The following settings were found by probing the given server\".\r\n\r\nI'm sure that the server is configured correctly, because I could manually edit \"Outgoing Server (SMTP)\" in Account Settings to use \"SSL/TLS\" for \"Connection security\" and send messages without problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThunderbird should be able to find service on port 465 with SSL/TLS by probing the given server. Actually, version 9.0.1 worked as expected, so it is a regression.\r\n\r\nI captured packets between the client and server using wireshark, and noticed that Thunderbird didn't send SSL client hello to port 465 after 3-way handshake, and just closed the connection.  imaps (993) and pop3s (995) are detected properly. I guess something is wrong with the service detection logic."

I had to add setTimeout calls to tell the findbar to find again until the result is found. The only case where these timeouts won't be stopped before the whole conversation has been displayed is if the found search term isn't in the displayed conversation.

The attribute name should probably be changed (\"highlight\"? \"unread\"?) once Andreas has some CSS changes to go with this patch. (It can trivially be edited in the _updateChatButtonState method. It would also be trivial to have the number of unread messages in the attribute; if there's a way to display that inside the button and it's wanted)."

            "Composition: Add keyboard shortcuts for Zoom (Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0: ux-consistency with message reader), change shortcuts for font size to Ctrl+<, Ctrl+>"
        ],
        "FullDescription": "In preparation for compose-in-a-tab (Bug 449299), we should make zoom behaviour and its mouse and keyboard shortcuts consistent between message reader and message composition. At the same time, we'll fix some confusing inconsistencies and bugs in the current *zoom* vs. *change font size* UI/behaviour for composition, like bug 512968. I have recently documented the current confusion in Keyboard Shortcuts Article (1), so I know what I am talking about...\r\n\r\nFor easy reading, I'll refer to windows keyboard shortcuts only.\r\nYou'll can easily work out equivalents for other OS from Keyboard Shortcuts (1).\r\n\r\nSTR\r\n\r\n1 in message reader (as in FF), zoom in/out: Ctrl++, Ctrl+- (or Ctrl+mouse wheel), and reset the zoom to 100%: Ctrl+0\r\n2 in composition, try the same  (as in 1):\r\n2a) zoom in/out/reset using keyboard only\r\n2b) zoom in/out/reset using mouse+keyboard\r\n2c) zoom in/out/reset using mouse only\r\n\r\nActual result\r\n\r\n1 in message reader, everything's fine:\r\nkeyboard-only zoom works nicely, as in FF: Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0 (ok)\r\nmouse+keyboard: Ctrl+mouse wheel (ok)\r\nmouse only: View > Zoom menu (ok)\r\n\r\n2 in composition, confusion and bugs:\r\n\r\n2a zoom *keyboard only*: not possible (no keyboard shortcuts implemented for zoom)\r\nconfusingly, zoom keyboard shortcuts ctrl++, ctrl+- are used to increase/decrease text size, albeit incomplete: no keyboard shortcut to reset the text size (ctrl+0 does nothing).\r\nBug 449299 (compose in a tab) will make this even more confusing.\r\nHaving different keyboard shortcuts for zoom in reader vs. composition  violates ux-consistency, and should be changed (ux-error-prevention).\r\n\r\n2b zoom *keyboard+mouse*: Ctrl+mouse wheel (ok); but practically no reliable way of resetting zoom to 100%, bug 512968.\r\n\r\n2c zoom *mouse only*: not possible\r\n\r\nFor people who need and use both: changing font size and zooming simultaneously, current UI/behaviour is ultimate confusion as we don't have any indication of the current zoom level nor any reliable way to reset it to 100% except guessing from sight (bug 512968). Try guessing 100% zoom for an increased font size...\r\n\r\nExpected result (changes/improvements proposed by this bug):\r\n\r\n* be ux-consistent\r\n* be accessible\r\n* be feature-complete\r\n\r\n2a) *keyboard only*\r\n- use the same zoom keyboard shortcuts for composition as in message reader (and FF), especially when we can compose in a tab, bug 449299:\r\nCtrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0 to zoom in/out/reset (anywhere); this will fix bug 512968.\r\n- implement new, distinct keyboard shortcuts for changing font size:\r\nCtrl+> to increase font size\r\nCtrl+< to decrease font size\r\n(and optionally, Ctrl+= to reset font size without resetting other text styles; otherwise there's Ctrl+Space to reset /all/ text styles incl. font size).\r\n\r\n2b) *keyboard+mouse* \r\n- basically, we're fine here, if we do 2a which will fix bug 512968.\r\n- optionally, consider adding a mouse+keyboard shortcut for resetting the zoom to 100%, so we could have:\r\nCtrl+mouse wheel up/down: zoom in/out\r\nCtrl+middle click (click on mouse wheel): reset zoom to 100% (or even toggle between 100% and the last custom zoom level).\r\n\r\n2c) *mouse only*\r\nFor full mouse-only access:\r\n- Add View > Zoom menu to composition window, same as message reader (easy, should be fixed in a separate bug)\r\n\r\n(1) https://support.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts"

I finally figured out the problem today, the browser elements created by specialTabs.js end up with the disablehistory attribute set on them. I have a workaround but it looks to me like this is a mistake caused by the landing of bug 677421.\r\n\r\nThat patch is too big for me to want to spend anytime trying to figure out exactly what the expectation is of these things, but here are two anomalies I can see that are likely bugs:\r\n\r\nThe overlay attempts to modify the dummycontentbrowser that all content browsers are cloned from to enable history by setting the disablehistory attribute to false. The problem is that that won't work, if the disablehistory attribute exists at all then history is disabled no matter its value.\r\nhttp://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/annotate/b438e21e3c6b/mail/base/content/webSearchTab.xul#l53\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this should be unnecessary anyway as the specialTabs code removes the disablehistory attribute on startup before any new content tabs are created\r\n(http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/specialTabs.js#500), this used to work fine but unfortunately bug 677421 also introduced a second element with the id \"dummycontentbrowser\" and it is this element that is now returned by getElementById(\"dummycontentbrowser\") so it is that that gets its dummycontentbrowser attribute removed instead.\r\nhttp://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/annotate/b438e21e3c6b/mail/base/content/webSearchTab.xul#l71\r\n\r\nMy best guess without really knowing what the rest of the OpenSearch code is up to is that renaming that new browser element to have a unique ID and removing the attempt to modify disablehistory from webSearchTab.xul should just make everything work."

I am using Thunderbird Daily 13.0 installed it this way:\r\n\r\nhttp://andrzejl.no-ip.org:10101/wordpress/2012/02/09/testing-mozilla-thunderbird-aurora-earlybird-12-safely-on-pclinuxos-2011-x/\r\n\r\nDon't mind that it says Aurora I am using Comm Central.\r\n\r\nI have attached a .png (does not matter what file is used) file and I have added a recipient of the message. I clicked Send button but before it was sent I have recalled that I was suppose to send this file to two recipients instead of one so I have cancelled the sending process and added another recipient to the BCC field.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nWhen trying to send e-mail I received this error:\r\n\r\n\"Sending of message failed.\r\nUnable to open the temporary file /path/to/the/file.png. Check your 'Temporary Directory' setting.\"\r\n\r\nWhen investigating the error I have noticed one thing. The file .png that I have attached to the message was gone from the hard drive. Luckily I had backup of the file... So I copied backed up file to the folder again and repeated the steps (sending, canceling, sending again) and it happened yet again. I tried different files with different extensions. Makes no difference. If You cancel sending the message and the message contains attachment the attached file will get deleted from hard drive... Really nasty bug (a lot of people will learn the hard way to backup their files :D).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe file should remain untouched on the hard drive after sending message was canceled."

But they reuse the existing icons used for Next/Previous (Unread) message.\r\n\r\nSo new icons should be created to differentiate the functions, as the button labels are intentionally identical.\r\n\r\nCurrently thre next/previous icons contain 2 blue arrows (at least in gnomestripe theme). Maybe the same design with 1 arrow could be drawn.\r\n\r\nThis bug needs somebody who knows to create those icons and land them into the theme files (mail-toolbar.png and mail-toolbar-small.png).\r\n\r\nAfter that I can make the necessary css updates in the theme to make the buttons use the new icons."

What happens next is the conversation view kicks back in to grab the multimessage. Because the old \"stub.xhtml\" value is still held in \".href\", the FrameManager thinks everything is fine, and instructs the conversation view to proceed (because the document currently loaded is the right one). Next thing we know, loading folderSummary.xhtml *actually* happens, but:\r\n- the folderSummary callback was cancelled by the conversation view's\r\n- the conversation view's callback fails miserably because, of course, the loaded document is not the right one.\r\n\r\nI'm really puzzled, and I'm unsure what we should do at that stage"

In very few cases, fixes and improvements might be preliminary or incomplete because I cannot verify shortcuts on Linux and MAC. I have filed respective bugs which are awaiting verification.\r\n\r\nThis revision is a major milestone as it concludes a series of major revisions to reconvert \"Keyboards Shortcuts\" into a useful document that keeps the promise with complete, accurate, and accessible information. Still, it may not be the end of the road (and nobody/nothing is perfect). For further refinements, pls refer to tbkbd-doc-tracker Bug 714031 and tbkbd-docnew-tracker Bug 714044.

That revision makes the markup just so much more readable and easier to maintain:\r\n\r\n- correct markup for keyboard shortcuts:\r\ne.g. nifty {key Ctrl+Shift+Tab}\r\ninstead of wrong and bulky {button Ctrl} + {button Shift} + {button Tab}\r\n\r\n- correct markup for identical cross-OS shortcuts:\r\ne.g. slim {for win,linux}{key...}{/for}{for mac}{key...}{/for}\r\ninstead of redundant and confusing {for win}{key...}{/for}{for mac}{key...}{/for}{for linux}{key...}{/for}\r\n\r\nI'll approve sreepriya's revision 5594 (2) to acknowledge and preserve this revolutionary improvement. It comes with a number of minor glitches which I will fix with my upcoming revision documented here.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have once again fixed a whole lot of previously existing issues:\r\n- fix/improve wrong/misleading/insufficient command captions\r\n- fix/remove wrong/outdated keyboard shortcuts (wip)\r\n- add product version selectors for some shortcuts that changed (what's the point of having the version selector if we don't maintain it?)\r\n- minor changes to the sequence of shortcuts in the list (wip)\r\n- add OS-sensitive markup in the introduction\r\n- cross the t's and dot the i's in the markup, removing extra spaces etc.\r\n\r\nI might add the bugs which I have touched with this revision as dependants of this bug (unless specified otherwise in subsequent comments). In some cases, fixes and improvements might be preliminary or incomplete because I can't verify shortcuts on Linux and MAC. I have filed respective bugs which are awaiting verification.\r\n\r\nThe revision documented here is an incremental update but it's not the end of the road. A lot more needs to be done, pls refer to tbkbd-doc-tracker Bug 714031 and tbkbd-docnew-tracker Bug 714044 for details.\r\n\r\nAny hints or comments regarding this revision are welcome here."

(Which ultimately means two tabs/windows to close, and the clutter is multiplied by however many feed items the user is in the habit of opening and then viewing in a browser rather than Thunderbird.)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nWhen double-clicking a feed item, would like the option to open its \"Website\" header field directly in my default browser, without first spawning a new Thunderbird tab/window.\r\n\r\nAkin to having an option for default functionality something like one or more of the following...\r\n\r\n   \"View > Feed Message Body As... > In Browser\"\r\n\r\n   secondary mouse click feed item > context menu: \"Open Message in Browser\"\r\n\r\n   \"Tools > Options > Reading & Display > Open feed message in: > Browser\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the content of the feed item itself and the content of the linked \"Website\" header field are technically two distinct things. But I'm rarely interested in the feed item's own content, separate from the linked \"Website\" field. Also, the feed item's own content would still presumably be visible/previewed within Thunderbird's Message Pane (it that's open), and could be opened in a Thunderbird window using a secondary mouse click and choosing \"Open Message in New Tab/New Window\" from the context menu."

What is that? Page-down also has a down arrow! Oh, you mean \"cursor down\"? I think we are creating more problems than we're solving by using simplified language here (and elsewhere, needs a new bug).\r\n- Caveat1: Alt+Cursor down does NOT work as a general keyboard shortcut from the compose window for adding recipients; iow, from most parts of the UI, it does nothing.\r\n- Caveat2: Alt+Cursor down only ever works for the very specific scenario when you are *inside one of the recipient fields*, but then:\r\n- Caveat3: Even in the header, Alt+Cursor down does NOT *add* any recipients unless you happen to be in the *last* recipient; for any other recipient field, it's just \"*Move* to the next recipient\".\r\n- Caveat4: Alt+Cursor *up* is not even implemented (it probably should! needs a new bug), so what's the point of memorizing this? (btw, we should be more flexible for moving up between recipients...)\r\n- I doubt that anyone will ever need this, because it's far easier to use ENTER for almost exactly the same purpose (the only difference being that Alt+Cursor Down will preserve per-recipient selection of text, while ENTER or Tab, Tab, will select all of the recipient's text. But then, who really needs to preserve a previous *partial* selection of another recipient?)\r\n\r\nExpected Documentation:\r\n\r\n- Given that a simple ENTER does the trick nicely (and is probably easy enough to discover so that it doesn't need documentation, at least not on the keyboard shortcuts page), and given all the caveats above, I think we should just *remove this shortcut entry* altogether.\r\n\r\n- Otherwise, find a more precise description, and/or include ENTER as an alternative (with adequate description where it applies)"

Open up the profile's localstore.rdf file, and find the folderPaneBox description entry.\r\n3)  For the folderPaneBox description entry, add an attribute collapsed=\"true\".\r\n\r\nYour folderPaneBox description entry should now look something like this:\r\n\r\n<RDF:Description RDF:about=\"chrome://messenger/content/messenger.xul#folderPaneBox\"\r\n                   collapsed=\"true\"\r\n                   width=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nNow start up Thunderbird with Tabs on Top, and switch to the 3pane.\r\n\r\nWhat happens:\r\n\r\nIt's a race condition, so it doesn't always happen - but a number of times, the folderPane will be collapsed by default on startup.\r\n\r\nWhat's expected:\r\n\r\nThe attribute should be ignored, like it has been for years and years.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nSo localstore.rdf can potential contain a lot of fragments of old UI customization parameters (like info on toolbars that no longer exist, etc).  Sometimes, the elements that those customization parameters apply to still do exist, but the attributes are supposed to be ignored - like in the case of folderPaneBox.\r\n\r\nWhat's more; when going to View > Layout, and setting the Folder Pane attribute to visible, it doesn't work the first time, only the second.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is still a poorly understood bug at this time."

Instead of putting more special-purpose calls in the attachment manipulation functions, we should just use the observer service and send out some appropriate notifications. Here's what I'm thinking:\r\n\r\n* attachmentAdded: fired when a single attachment is added (passes in the new attachment)\r\n* attachmentRemoved: fired when a single attachment is removed (passes in the\r\n  ex-attachment)\r\n* attachmentBatchAdded: fired when a group of attachments are added (e.g. if you add 3\r\n  attachments from a file picker)\r\n* attachmentBatchRemoved: fired when a group of attachments are deleted (e.g. if you\r\n  delete 3 attachments at once)\r\n* attachmentRenamed: fired when an attachment is renamed\r\n\r\nThus, if you attach 3 files at once from the file picker, it calls attachmentAdded three times, and then attachmentBatchAdded once.\r\n\r\nThis would be less invasive, so we could put BigFiles and the attachment reminder in separate .js files, and for the attachment reminder, we could make it more efficient (currently it listens for every attachment added, when it could listen for attachmentBatchAdded). It would also open up the possibility for add-ons to do fun and exciting things with this information as well!"

I didn't want to go down the refactor hole.\r\n* Note that the lack of an argument defaults to a true value.\r\n* Is the '=== undefined' a suitable replacement for checking the length of the arguments pseudo-array?\r\n* I still need to write the additional tests."

Assuming a 7.0.2 release is coming out:\r\n\r\n* 6.0 -> 7.0.2 get prompted (this would be the page for the 7.0 release, set up by redirects).\r\n* 7.0 -> 7.0.2 don't get prompted.\r\n* 7.0.1 -> 7.0.2 don't get prompted.\r\n\r\nRafael: are you happy with this? If we find we need it for some reason, we can always back the code out for that release.\r\n\r\nNote that Firefox is working on a way to cover what happens at update via the update snippets that AUS sends out. They've not quite finished yet, and it'll be a few versions before we get there, so I'd like to do this as a stop-gap."

Also, getting rid of the overlays, and doing the right tweaks instead of monkey-patching all sorts of stuff.\r\n\r\nPer the phone discussion with JB, here's a list of things that we should watch for.\r\n1. Interaction with opensearch (what happens if the user has made a search engine his favorite choice through opensearch, and he then gets an account through one of our add-supported partners?).\r\n2. Make sure the list of providers is stored remotely so that we can add new partners without having to deploy a new version of Thunderbird (Blake, I believe this is in place already, can you confirm this?).\r\n3. Make sure the API for creating an account (i.e. the remote API) is well-defined. Apparently, this is not the case for Yahoo.\r\n4. Another item related to configuring specific email accounts which I wrote down, but I'm not sure what this is supposed to refer to. Jb, thoughts?\r\n\r\nI'll be mainly posting updates for the patch, and pinging Blake and maybe Andreas for design decisions, appearance stuff, etc.\r\n\r\nBlake, here's some questions for you.\r\n- why did you rewrite the new ComposeMessage function? there doesn't seem to be anything specific in it,\r\n- I'm not sure I understand what you wanted to overlay with mailWizardOverlay.xul,\r\n- hopefully I didn't miss any place where one can create a new account.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any thoughts / comments, here would be a great place to keep them."

While this is great for detecting bugs, it is somewhat less so for seeing exactly what went wrong. The alternative is to use waitFor and pass in a string, but that doesn't directly allow printing the state of something after it's timed out, just an effectively static string.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this seems be to wrap the data in an object which when toString() is called does whatever mark_failure does, and pass this object in as the second argument to waitFor. We're essentially tricking mozmill into calling mark_failure whenever an error happens."

It does depend on pypng [1] though, and we're going to need to get it on at least the Windows builders to get the patch to work. We seem to have at least three options to do so:\r\n1. Get Mozilla-Build to include it. It's pure python, so not a hassle at all to include.\r\n2. Add it to the comm-central repo. It's MIT-licensed and build-only, so I don't really see an issue there.\r\n3. Get people on Windows to easy_install it. easy_install pypng.\r\n\r\nMark, Gozer, opinions?\r\n\r\nWe could also use a more heavyweight library like the Python Imaging Library [2], but I don't really see the point in doing so."

What the patch does is make the space key scroll down the multimessage (if activated) before moving on to the next unread message.\r\n\r\nThis is (imho) a minor improvement for Thunderbird, but when thunderbird conversations is installed, it makes the space key scroll down the conversation as well, before jumping to the next unread message.\r\n\r\nThe bad thing is that when jumping to the next unread message, Thunderbird expands the thread the message belongs to, and just selects that message, instead of just selecting a collapsed thread. But that's another issue.\r\n\r\nBlake, I'm requesting review from you because I've been bothering Standard8 a lot lately. It's a very short patch, and it does the readability tweaks I mentioned over IRC earlier today."

It states that the thread pane should just have summaries, and that when you click on one of them it should show just the article (without comments, headers etc.) in the default browser. \r\n\r\nIt displays the article in the message pane instead, changing the color of the summary to indicate its read. I have the message pane enabled because that is how I like to read email. I disabled the message pane and clicked on a different summary. That did literally nothing (doesn't display anything or mark it as read). \r\n\r\nI right clicked on the same summary and chose \"Open message in new tab\" from the context menu. That opened a tab that displayed the article, and changed the summary to indicate it was read.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the correct behavior is supposed to be. I don't think its as simple as the Litmus test case needs to be updated to replace \"viewing in the default browser\" with displaying it in Thunderbird because it never created a tab/window unless I used the context menu, and most people don't enable the message pane.\r\n\r\nI initially used http://planet.mozillamessaging.com/rss20.xml when this problem occurred. I was able to read some articles that way but many took over 3 minutes to load, and never loaded the images. I did not have any problem or delay reading that blog entry using a browser.\r\n\r\nReselecting that article discarded the loaded article and started to load it again. It was very annoying to wait several minutes for less than 2 dozen lines of text on a DSL connection that consistently gets about 2514 Kbps (according to both the flash and java based speed tests at www.dslreports.com). I can't find any way to display the images. I tried right clicking on the image, selecting \"copy image\" and then pasting that into IrfanView. That pasted the URL instead. However, there were other articles where it displayed the images. When that happened right clicking on the image and selecting \"copy image\" did copy the image.\r\n\r\nIn general I found the RSS reader incredibly slow. Even when it worked it could take as long to fetch one article as it took a browser to open the complete blog page (52 articles). The only case where I found the performance not an issue was with http://www.schneier.com/blog/index.rdf , and its entire feed (of 5 articles) was about 30 lines of text and no images. \r\n"

One piece of bad behavior from this software is that it apparently inserts a plain comma, all by itself, in the CC field.  (This is a bit of sloppiness in the handling of multiple CC recipients that is being addressed in that software).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it exposed a nasty bug in Thunderbird that does not manifest in other email clients.  When you are reading a mail message (particularly in the three-pane window) that has a CC field with just a single comma in it, you get the following behavior:\r\n\r\n1) In the bottom view pane, Thunderbird always \"fills in\" the recipients that were CC'ed on the last message you read before this one.  They're not really there (as one can confirm from Viewing Message Source), but it's jarring nonetheless.\r\n\r\n2) There's often the same effect with the Subject line - in the bottom view pane, it replaces the legitimate Subject line of the email you're viewing with the Subject line of your last viewed message.\r\n\r\nLooking at the View Message Source, I see that the Subject line is right after the CC line.  So you might have something like this in the source:\r\n\r\nCC: ,\r\nSUBJECT: Real subject line here\r\n\r\n... but it displays in the bottom pane as:\r\n\r\nfrom (correct sender)\r\nsubject (wrong subject from previous message)\r\nto (you)\r\ncc (people from previous message)\r\n\r\n\r\nReproducible: Always\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot sure how to create what is clearly a malformed email (with CC: ,) ... but if you can, you'll see what I'm talking about.  If you need me to forward you such a message, give me an email to shoot it to.\r\n\r\nBecause of course, when I try to make the well-behaved Thunderbird message creation window do this, it won't.  Good Thunderbird."

This is an improvement for users frequently receiving many attachments, or with mostly inlined-displayed content (images or text) for which the attachment list and icons would be redundant.\r\n\r\nHowever, another class of users will typically receive a small amount of attachments, and they may not be displayable inline (e.g., PDF or Word files). Consequently, these users now need a click more, (1) open the attachment pane, (2) double-click on the attachment to open it. Even more, if just a single attachment is received, its name is presented next to the button, but that label isn't clickable and thus can't be used to open the attachment.\r\n\r\nA couple of possible solutions to this issue:\r\n\r\n(a) Add an explicit preference setting whether top open collapsed=true/false;\r\n(b) remember the last setting (opened or closed) and use it for the next opened\r\n    message (may be more intuitive than a hidden pref);\r\n(c) have some \"more\"-style mechanism, thus showing a single row of attachments\r\n    and allow it to expand with the button if more attachments are present\r\n    (this would be my personal favorite, easily allowing the first attachments\r\n    to be accessed while not filling up considerable space if more than one\r\n    row is needed)."

            "improve fancy mozmill logging, round 2"
        ],
        "FullDescription": "Here are some logging improvements I would like to land because they will help me fight our fairly consistent intermittent oranges.  I was trying to use these on the try server to help, but the failures didn't actually happen on the try server for the two pushes I performed (with some minor logging changes between the two).  This either means my logging changes alter timing enough to stop the intermittent oranges, or there is some horrible subtle difference between the try runs and the non-try runs.  (Packages tests versus non-packaged?)\r\n\r\nOne thing made obvious to me is I'm not sure how to make buildbot just re-run unit tests.  I have access to the admin variant, but all I could see was a way to order it to do a complete rebuild of a push.  I told it to do that for one of the linux builders, but since I haven't seen the results show up yet, I presume it did not work right.  Or I killed buildbot, because I can't get it to respond right now so I can see the buildbot waterfall instead of depending on tinderbox.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogging improvements:\r\n\r\n- Better identify windows by more consistently reporting their window type and by tagging all windows with unique integers that we report.\r\n\r\n- Introduced a \"b\" class of logging for \"winhelp\" and \"fdh\" for boring events.  This is really just a presentation thing that's the lesser evil versus complicating the client side a lot more at this point.\r\n\r\n- Map keyCode values to VK_CONSTANTS and show charCodes as actual characters for keypress events.\r\n\r\n- Log window activation/deactivation.  (Note: only happens once we augment the windows.  The resulting event stream for when a new window shows up tends to be: \"window we know about deactivates\", \"we augment the new window\", \"we hear about the new window deactivating in favor of some other window we already knew about\".    I tried to hook us up during the onOpenWindow event, but could not readily poke our unique id anywhere and do not believe the blind spot is large enough to justify figuring out how to actually make that work at this time.)"

At the time of event generation, there is no focused element in the window, but I don't think that should actually affect anything (and the window proper will just catch it; this needs more investigation/remembering).\r\n\r\nA possibility for the greater problem is that at the time we generate the failure notification, the Thunderbird window is not the active window, suggesting we may just be refusing to generate the event because the window is not focused.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of those analyses where it would be nice to be able to easily see what the logging shows for a healthy run of the test.  Unfortunately, it's prohibitively expensive to log that data for successful tests for every run.\r\n\r\nOne easier way to address this without getting crazy would be to let us annotate specific runs as deserving of having their output logged every time.  We would do this by either leveraging the try server or doing a short-lived test-only type patch.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to have runs where we do dump everything, but have that be a special buildbot job that only runs once a week or something.  The arbpl server would need to special-case these runs, but could then offer a \"compare with baseline\" option."

I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.\r\n\r\nAlternately, we could do it the same way as before, but this would mean that we'd probably want to check for Gmail servers and disable the archive options dialog in bug 607295, since changing those prefs wouldn't actually do anything."

The data held by the outer code might be a closure, some component that the outer code has instantiated, some parameter, or whatever...\r\n\r\nSolution 1:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n  Outer code (myCodeModule.jsm):\r\n    1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", { chromeUrl: ... });\r\n    2: tab.browser.contentWindow.myFunc(myData);\r\n  Inner code (myChromePage.html):\r\n    3: function myFunc(aMyData) {\r\n    4:   ...\r\n    5: }\r\n\r\n  This is not a solution because, as http://hsivonen.iki.fi/about-blank/ tells\r\n  us, the <browser> that makes the chrome tab will start loading about:blank,\r\n  and we have no guarantee about the sequence of events. We'd like to make sure\r\n  that line 2: executes after the chrome page has been fully loaded and is\r\n  operational, but AFAIK, we have no such guarantee.\r\n\r\nSolution 2:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n  Outer code (myCodeModule.jsm):\r\n    1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", { chromeUrl: ... });\r\n    2: tab.browser.myData = ...;\r\n  Inner code (myChromePage.html):\r\n    3: document.addEventListener(\"onload\", function _myCallback () {\r\n    4:   let myData = top.myData;\r\n    5: });\r\n\r\n  This is not a solution because, as http://hsivonen.iki.fi/about-blank/ tells\r\n  us, the <browser> that makes the chrome tab will start loading about:blank,\r\n  and we have no guarantee about the sequence of events. We'd like to be sure\r\n  that _myCallback will never be called between lines 1 and 2, but AFAIK, we\r\n  have no such guarantee.\r\n  \r\nOther non-solutions:\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n  - Pass the data as a URL parameter: not feasible, because the data cannot be\r\n    easily stringified.\r\n  - Use a global array, store the data in the array, pass the index to the inner\r\n    chrome page, have the chrome page retrieve its data using the global array.\r\n    Ugly.  \r\n    \r\nProposed solution:\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n  Outer code:\r\n    1: tabmail.openTab(\"chromeTab\", {\r\n    2:   chromeUrl: ...,\r\n    3:   onLoad: function (aEvent, aBrowser) {\r\n    4:     aBrowser.contentWindow.doStuff(withMyData);\r\n    5:   },\r\n    6: });\r\n  Inner code:\r\n    1: function doStuff(aMyData) { ... }\r\n\r\n  This solution has the advantage of offering all the guarantees we need. Plus,\r\n  it is intuitive, and in the course of developing a few addons, I've wanted\r\n  this everytime I've been interacting with content tabs. This solution is\r\n  implemented by the patch attached.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something, but I remember discussing this extensively with\r\nbwinton (CC'd) over IRC, and if I recall correctly, we both came to the\r\nconclusion that I had to submit such a patch or duplicate the chromeTab\r\nfunctionnality in my own code and add the required hook."

I assume this is intentional (so the tabs don't expand/shrink when you switch to/from a tab where the qfb is useless), but this has two problems:\r\n\r\n1) When looking at Lightning tabs, there's a big empty space where the qfb\r\n   button would be, which looks weird.\r\n2) The visilibity:hidden style appears to be applied to the menuitem in View ->\r\n   Toolbar as well, so there's an invisible row. Based on the comments, it looks\r\n   like this should actually appear as disabled, not invisible.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best way to fix (1) would be, but you could probably fix (2) by setting an attribute on the button and then use a CSS selector to make it invisible, which would hopefully not mess with the menuitem. I'm not totally sure this would work though, since I think the problem is some strangeness with the observes attribute on the menuitem."

For example, render a canvas-based screenshot of each window and characterize broad UI state (what window is focused, what widget in that window is focused, high-level tab info which may not be obvious from the screenshot).\r\n\r\nb) Provide \"event timeline\" data for the time period shortly before the start of the test up through declaration of the failure.  The canonical example of such events is folderEventLogHelper.js which provides an nsIMsgFolderListener and reports everything it hears using logHelper's mark_action.  This data would normally be written into an in-memory buffer and discarded in cases where a test does not fail.\r\n\r\nc) Provide hooks for specific tests/test families to provide additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) \"Report\" that information by either writing it to a file or printing it out on stdout.  The stdout idea is for tinderbox.  We can scrape the data out of the buildlog after the fact and do something useful with it without first having to stand up a reliable fancy data store.  (We can later move to having the run directly POST its results to a reliable infrastructure server if so desired.)"

Attached is a WIP XULRunner app with a new set of bindings for the attachment list (to be used in both the reader and the composer). Here's a short list of why this is better than the status quo:\r\n\r\n  1) it has built-in support for displaying file size (prettily)\r\n  2) it supports scrolling and scrolling-related methods\r\n  3) it has a less-stupid name\r\n  4) it has both a horizontal and vertical mode so it can be used in\r\n     multiple places (e.g. reader and composer)\r\n  5) up/down/left/right work as expected in horizontal mode\r\n  6) it works better when swapping view modes\r\n  7) it has smooth scrolling (so drag-and-drop reordering will be easier)\r\n  8) it matches platform theming of selected icons a la Windows Explorer\r\n     and friends (well, it will; currently only Windows theming is done)\r\n  9) easier to set context menus (via the itemcontext attribute)\r\n 10) built-in handling of attachment objects via appendItem\r\n\r\nIt may also be worth considering whether checkboxes should be used to select attachments (preferably this would be optional, since it would violate ux-consistency)."

In the networking core, this was changed by bug 309729 to use a formula (updated later by bug 296538) which determines the memory-cache size as a function of the physical RAM available on a machine.\r\n\r\nFrom mozilla/netwerk/cache/nsCacheService.cpp:\r\n>   RAM   Cache\r\n>   ---   -----\r\n>   32 Mb   2 Mb\r\n>   64 Mb   4 Mb\r\n>  128 Mb   6 Mb\r\n>  256 Mb  10 Mb\r\n>  512 Mb  14 Mb\r\n> 1024 Mb  18 Mb\r\n> 2048 Mb  24 Mb\r\n> 4096 Mb  30 Mb\r\n>\r\n> The equation for this is (for cache size C and memory size K (kbytes)):\r\n>  x = log2(K) - 14\r\n>  C = x^2/3 + x + 2/3 + 0.1 (0.1 for rounding)\r\n>  if (C > 32) C = 32\r\n\r\nGiven that 4MB cache feels ridiculously low these days, adopting this for TB\r\nas well makes sense (especially since many providers have a message-size limit around 30MB now). Ideally, the memory cache should be large enough to keep a full message without having to consult the disk or the network again when revisiting it after a short visit to another message.\r\n\r\nI've been using \"-1\" as default for SeaMonkey without seeing any issues with Mail/News, and have tried both \"32768\" and \"-1\" on Thunderbird without any performance issues, however noticing a better performance with large messages when the disk cache is disabled. This will minimally increase the memory footprint, but not beyond other Mozilla applications, and the benefits should justify it."

This has been happening on 2 machines over multiple OS and Thunderbird installs, folder rebuilds, etc.\r\n\r\nReproducible: Sometimes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Delete a few messages in fairly rapid succession (usually a second apart or less), using the Delete key in the message list pane.\r\n2. Move selection to a different message before Thunderbird is finished resolving the corresponding IMAP transactions, or as happened today, click the close button on an open message tab.\r\nActual Results:  \r\nThunderbird trashes or even deletes (which was _not_ the original action) some additional messages without being asked to.  And yes, I keep count of how many times I press Delete, so I'm getting n+1 deletions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  \r\nMy mail is where I left it, unmolested.\r\n\r\nA couple of other vaguely-related bits of weird UI and IMAP behaviour which -may- point to architectural issues behind this: (I'll file these as their own bugs eventually but for now they're quite possibly relevant to the overwhelmingly more important issue here)\r\n\r\n- Nondeterministic UI behaviour:  Quite frequently, closing a message tab, then quickly using cmd-1 to get back to the Inbox (or otherwise), will result in what appears to be the message preview pane appearing below the message list (I normally have it turned off), but it is NOT checked in the View > Layout menu.  Additionally, if I then go and turn it on, it changes appearance somewhat (thus \"what appears to be\").\r\n\r\n- Weird, probably overly-complicated management of folder actions:  Selecting a group of messages and pressing 'm' to toggle their read/unread status will result in them flipping back and forth to read/unread status a couple of times (I believe it's usually 2-3 transitions total, when one would expect one transition from a sane piece of software).\r\n\r\n- Often, using cmd-z to move a message back from the trash will result in the message coming back, and then disappearing a few seconds later.  I don't do this often enough to remember whether it goes back to the trash consistently or sometimes ends up deleted."

It does not indicate function. And even worse: This UI setting is remembered, so closing an re-opening the window does not help.\r\n\r\nIt seems natural to review the \"view\" menu in this case, but it offers no command to restore the address books pane.\r\n\r\nFor a user who is not actively maintaining his/her address books, the problem is aggravated by the fact that the first default address book \"personal addresses\" may be empty and all addresses are stored in \"collected addresses\".\r\nAs the first address book is always selected when opening the address books window (regardless of the last selected book), it might appear to the user that all addresses are simply gone.\r\n\r\nReproducible: Always\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open address book window\r\n2. drag vertical splitter to the left beyond the point at which the address books pane instantly collapses\r\nActual Results:  \r\nAddress books appear to be gone and there is no menu command to make them reappear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  \r\nAddress books pane should not collapse completely.\r\nOr if it has to:\r\n- This should happen smoothly, not with an instant snap of the splitter to the left.\r\n- The splitter, being at the far left, should have a strong visual cue that something is hidden and can be made to reappear by clicking/dragging.\r\n- There should be a command in the view menu to toggle th address books pane visibility.\r\n\r\nThe described problem occurred to my girlfriend. After she complained to me that \"all my addresses are gone\", I investigated and it took me - as a software developer and long-time Thunderbird user - several minutes to spot the splitter in the far left (btw: the window was maximized, which makes it even harder to spot).\r\n\r\nOthers might be driven to reinstall Thunderbird, restore their profile from a backup or whatever."

Talking to Ubuntu folks at UDS-N, we discussed what changes need to happen in Thunderbird to fit in to the new shell.\r\n\r\nThis is a meta bug.  We'll file dependent bugs for each bit.  For context though, the broad strokes are:\r\n\r\n - Unity has a global menu rather than in-window menu (similar to what OS X does).  Thunderbird should use that menu when run under Unity.  Note that the shell can be chosen at runtime, so compile time decisions aren't appropriater here (unlike the mac).\r\n\r\n - Unity includes a task list for each app that registers in the dock.  Thunderbird should register tasks (and there are different tasks possible when the app is running and not).  This is likely related from the TB point of view to Windows 7 jump lists.\r\n\r\n - Unity includes a single messaging menu in the top right (in LTR locales), which all messaging apps should use to communicate things like number of new messages, etc.  Thunderbird should integrate there as well.\r\n\r\nNote that AFAICT the way to do this is to talk via DBUS, which will likely require changes in mozilla-central, such as integration in the gtk event loop, etc.  (We should find whatever bug currently tracks that work).\r\n\r\n(this meta-bug does not attempt to address non-Unity related Ubuntu integration issues like integration with contacts, etc., which should be tracked in other bugs)."

I don't think this is just a case of \"patch Thunderbird to suit my needs\", because I'm pretty sure the extension that does account summary and folder summary has to workaround this too, and this might simplify its life if it could just assume that whenever someones actually needs to display something in the multimessage pane, then that someone takes care of having the right URL loaded.\r\n\r\ndavida, mixedpuppy, thoughts?\r\n\r\n(I have a patch waiting somewhere so if you think that's a good idea, I'll just assign to me and submit a patch as soon as I have a decent development environment and work machine)."

            "Attached .rtf files are opened as though they were flat text (TXT) files and show all the control characters"
        ],
        "FullDescription": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8\r\nBuild Identifier: v3.1.2  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100802 Thunderbird/3.1.2\r\n\r\nWhen I double click on a .rtf (Rich Text Format) file attached to an email I have received, the default application (I have associated OpenOffice Writer which can read .rtf files) opens the file as a flat text (ie a TXT) file and displays all the control characters.  It does not respect the .rtf qualifier.\r\n\r\nIf the file is called fred.rtf, the OO Writer bar shows \"fred.rtf-4.txt (Read only) - OpenOffice.org Writer\".  The 4 increments by 1 every time I retry.  This means that Thunderbird appears to have appended a TXT qualifier after the RTF qualifier.  OO Writer is therefore being told that this is a TXT file, not an RTF file.  No doubt this is why I see all the control characters.\r\n\r\nIf I detach fred.rft and save it to my hard disk, OpenOffice opens the file properly and I see the correct contents.  This is as expected - OpenOffice can read and write .rtf files.  The file is obviously OK.\r\n\r\nI am running Windows 7 so I looked in the temporary folder C:\\Users\\my_name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp where Thunderbird creates the temporary, read only file it views. When I double clicked on the .rtf file attached to the email, a file called fred.rtf.txt appeared in the Temp folder, and OpenOffice opened this file. \r\n\r\nIf I forward the received email with the attached fred.rtf file, then while I am editing the email I am forwarding, I can open the attached fred.rtf file with Writer, and it opens OK.  When I check in the Temp folder, the file Thunderbird has created is called nsmail-8.tmp - ie it is NOT a TXT, nor an RTF file. OO obviously pens this TMP file OK.\r\n\r\nThe email header is:\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\r\nname=\"fred.rtf\"\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\r\nfilename=\"fred.rtf\"\r\n\r\nAs a test, I renamed the file in \\Temp from fred.rtf.txt to fred.rtf - that is I just removed the extra .txt extension added by Thunderbird.  When I double clicked on the renamed file in the Temp folder, it opened OK in OO. \r\n\r\nSome recipients of my emails with attached RTF files have commented that they cannot open the RTF files. \r\n\r\nThere appear to be a number of similar bugs reported - namely https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213393, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205871 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580585\r\n\r\nReproducible: Always\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create an RTF file called fred.rtf which contains the single text word zebra.\r\n\r\n2.  Edit and email and attach the file fred.rtf to the email.\r\n\r\n3.  While I am editing the email, if I click on fred.rtf, it opens OK and I see the word zebra.\r\n\r\n4  Send myself the email.  \r\n\r\n5  Receive the email and click on the fred.rtf attachment in order to open it.  It opens with my default application OpenOffice Writer, but all the control characters are shown, namely\r\n{\\rtf1\\ansi\\deff0\\adeflang1025\r\n{\\fonttbl{\\f0\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f1\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f2\\fswiss\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Arial;}{\\f3\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f4\\froman\\fprq0\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f5\\fnil\\fprq0\\fcharset0 times new roman{\\*\\falt new york};}{\\f6\\fmodern\\fprq1\\fcharset128 MS Mincho{\\*\\falt \\'82\\'6c\\'82\\'72 \\'96\\'be\\'92\\'a9};}{\\f7\\fnil\\fprq0\\fcharset0 Mangal;}} ... etc\r\n\r\n3  Detach fred.rtf from the email and store it on my hard disk.  Open it with OO - it opens OK and I see the word zebra.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  \r\nWhen I open an RTF file I expect to see only the formatted text - I do not expect to see all the control characters.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to detach the rtf file from the email before opening.\r\n\r\nWhy does the temporary file in C:\\ ...\\Temp have TXT added as its qualifier after RTF??\r\n\r\nWindows 7 Home 64 bit, 4GB, dual core CPU"

        ],
        "FullDescription": "This bug was reported in Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/bugs/630281\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you set Thunderbird to be the default mail client from the Thunderbird UI on GNOME, it sets \"/desktop/gnome/url-handlers/mailto/command\" to something like $XCurProcD/thunderbird (on Ubuntu, this path is currently /usr/lib/thunderbird-3.1.3/thunderbird).\r\n\r\nThis has a couple of problems:\r\n\r\n1) It breaks upgrades if the path has the version number in it (which is the Ubuntu bug). Ok, I suppose that could also be argued as a distro-problem too.\r\n\r\n2) It causes the default mail client in gnome-default-application-properties to be displayed as \"Custom\" rather than \"Thunderbird\". This is because the settings dialog expects the setting to just be an executable in the users path. I suppose that could be changed too, but that isn't how other applications work.\r\n\r\n3) Setting the default mail client in gnome-default-application-properties to Thunderbird doesn't stop Thunderbird asking to be the default mail client.\r\n\r\nThe way I think that this should work is:\r\n\r\n1) If thunderbird is in the users path and it is a symbolic link to something in $XCurProcD, set the key to \"thunderbird %s\", else...\r\n2) Fall back to \"$XCurProcD/thunderbird %s\".\r\n\r\nSo, most users with a single install of Thunderbird will have the key set to \"thunderbird %s\". It also allows for users to download, extract and run other instances of Thunderbird if they want to, and still be able to set them as the default mail client too, without installing them properly (it would just use the full path for those in that case).\r\n\r\nAttached is a first attempt at a patch to implement this behaviour, which is working ok here."

Furthermore, this importer does not appear to be a part of the Mac distribution (as of Thunderbird 3.1.1), and must be searched for and installed separately.
